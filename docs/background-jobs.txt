Background Jobs
===============

Queueing is the key to building truly scalable web apps. Don't do any heavy
lifting in the web processes (Mongrel/Thin); instead, put things on a queue
and do the work in a background process. This ensures that web requests can
always return immediately.

A good rule of thumb is to avoid web requests which run longer than 500ms.
If you find that your app has requests which are take one, two, or more
seconds to complete, then you should consider using background jobs instead.

Introduction to job queues
--------------------------

Fetching data from remote APIs, reading RSS feeds, resizing images, and
uploading data to S3 are all examples of tasks that should be processed as
background jobs. The web hit that requests the job places it in queue and
returns to the client immediately. The client can then poll for updates to
see when their job is complete.

Consider the example of a web-based RSS reader. An app like this will have
a form where users can submit a new feed URL to be read. After a delay, the
user will be taken to a page where they can see the contents of the feed. A
simple but non-scalable way to do this would be to run it directly inside
the web request, like this:

    class FeedsController
      def create
        feed = Feed.create! params
        feed.fetch
        redirect_to feed_url(feed)
      end
    end

The fetch action in the model is the potentially heavy part of this:

    class Feed < ActiveRecord::Base
      def fetch
        xml = RestClient.get url
        # ... do read and parse the feed, putting the results in the database
      end
    end

In the example, `feed.fetch` will go out to the network and pull down the
data from the feed, inserting the results into the database. Sometimes this
may happen in as little as a few hundred milliseconds, other times it may
take several seconds. If the feed's server is down, it could hang for 30
seconds or more until the request times out. Tying up your app's dyno during
this time prevents it from handling other requests, and leaves your user
hanging, wondering if your app is working properly. This is okay for a
single user, but as soon as your app has multiple simultaneous users, you'll
find that response times become more and more inconsistent.

A better approach is to add the work-to-be-done to a queue:

    class FeedController
      def create
        feed = Feed.create! params
        Delayed::Job.enqueue feed
        redirect_to url_for(feed)
      end
    end

One or more worker processes, running separately (not serving web requests)
will read items off the queue one by one and do the work asynchronously.  The
results will be placed in the database when finished.

Handling long-running work with background workers has many benefits.  It
avoids tying up your web dynos, preventing them from serving other requests,
and keeping your site snappy.  You can monitor and control the worker
processes independently, and manage and introspect the queue to manage your
site's load.  And the user experience for those visiting your site will be
greatly improved when they get an immediate response to any page viewed,
even if that response is only to say that their request has been received
and is currently being processed.

Delayed Job (DJ) - background jobs for Rails
--------------------------------------------

[Delayed Job][gh], also known as DJ, is a queueing system for Rails written
by Tobias Lütke of Shopify. It stores jobs in a table named `delayed_jobs`
in your app's database.

To use, install the DJ plugin in your Rails app:

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/tobi/delayed_job.git

Create a database migration for the delayed_jobs table:

    $ script/generate migration create_delayed_jobs

Edit the created migration to contain:

    class CreateDelayedJobs < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def self.up
        create_table :delayed_jobs, :force => true do |table|
          table.integer  :priority, :default => 0      # jobs can jump to the front of
          table.integer  :attempts, :default => 0      # retries, but still fail eventually
          table.text     :handler                      # YAML object dump
          table.string   :last_error                   # last failure
          table.datetime :run_at                       # schedule for later
          table.datetime :locked_at                    # set when client working this job
          table.datetime :failed_at                    # set when all retries have failed
          table.string   :locked_by                    # who is working on this object
          table.timestamps
        end
      end
      def self.down
        drop_table :delayed_jobs
      end
    end

Run your migrations, and now you're ready to put something in your queue.
(John Nunemaker has an [excellent tutorial][tt] that goes into more detail
on setting up DJ.)

Continuing the feed example from the previous section, you might have a
class like this:

    class Feed < ActiveRecord::Base
      def perform
        xml = RestClient.get url
        # ... do work to read and parse the feed and place it in the database
      end
    end

DJ can queue any object that responds to a `perform` method.  In this case,
calling `perform` will cause the feed to go out and fetch the latest info
from the URL, and store the results in the database. Now we can queue it
with this bit of code:

    Delayed::Job.enqueue Feed.create!(:url => 'http://adam.blog.heroku.com/feed')

This returns immediately, as no work has been done yet. The job is now on
the queue, which you can see in your Rails console:

    >> Delayed::Job.find(:first)
    => #<Delayed::Job id: 8, priority: 0, attempts: 0, handler: "--- !ruby/obj ...

The job won't execute until a worker process exists to consume it.  Start
the worker process like this:

    $ rake jobs:work
    (in /home/adam/feedreader)
    *** Starting job worker host:silver pid:4227
    1 jobs processed at 7.0823 j/s, 0 failed ...

The worker process finds the job in queue, and performs it.  If you leave
this running and add more jobs to the queue, you'll see those jobs being
processed by the worker. Press `Ctrl-C` to exit when you no longer wish to
process jobs.

Using the DJ Heroku addon
-------------------------

Once your app uses DJ, you can start workers locally, or on a traditional
host, using `rake jobs:work`.  On Heroku, you can't start a worker this way
due to our dyno grid architecture; but you can use a DJ-powered app out of
the box by enabling the DJ addon.

    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku addons:add dj
    Adding dj to widgets...done.

Once the addon is installed, Heroku will start and manage a single DJ worker
process for this app.  You can shut down the worker process by removing the
addon:

    $ heroku addons:remove dj
    Removing dj from widgets...done.
