Beta Add-ons
============

DJ
--

Delayed::Job is a Rails plugin for running background jobs.  You should use it if you have any processing that goes on in your app that takes more than a few hundred milliseconds.

    $ script/plugin install git://github.com/tobi/delayed_job.git
    [...other DJ setup...]
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "use dj for queueing"
    $ git push heroku
    $ heroku addons:add dj
    Adding dj to myapp...done.

Your DJ background worker will spin up within a few seconds and begin processing jobs from the queue.
