Gem Bundler (BETA)
===========

Gem Bundler is the default gem manager for Rails 3, and can be used with any Ruby project as it has no dependency on framework.  Gem Bundler is under active development, and is not recommended for production use yet.  

NOTE: Bundler can only be used on the Bamboo stack.  Using Bundler with the Aspen stack is NOT supported.

Bundler Version
---------------
1.0.0.rc.5

Bundler is evolving quickly.  Heroku will try to stay as up-to-date as possible as Bundler releases new versions.  As this is experimental support, it is your responsibility to make sure you stay compatible with the latest version of Bundler.  Announcements of new versions will be posted to the [google group](http://groups.google.com/group/heroku/).

Using Bundler
-------------

To use, install bundler:

    :::term
    $ gem install bundler --pre

Create a file named Gemfile in the root of your app specifying what gems are required to run it:

    :::ruby
    source "http://rubygems.org"
    gem 'sinatra', '1.0'

Use Bundler to install all dependencies you have declared:

    :::term
    $ bundle install

The Gemfile and Gemfile.lock files should be added to your git repository.

Heroku also uses that file to resolve and install your application dependencies automatically. All you need to do is to push it:

    :::term
    -----> Heroku receiving push
    -----> Gemfile detected, running Bundler
           Unresolved dependencies detected; Installing...
           Fetching source index from http://gemcutter.org
           Resolving dependencies
           Installing mime-types (1.16) from rubygems repository at http://gemcutter.org 
           Installing rack (1.1.0) from rubygems repository at http://gemcutter.org 
           Installing sinatra (0.9.4) from rubygems repository at http://gemcutter.org 
           Your bundle is complete!
           Locking environment


Specifying gems & groups
------------------------

The recommended use of gem bundler is to bundle absolutely every gem your app depends upon.  This includes your framework (Rails, Sinatra, etc) and your database connectors. 

Bundling Rails and other dependencies does increase your slug size by a few megabytes.  Increased slug size is a worthwhile tradeoff for vastly simplified dependency management, as well as the flexibility of being able to use any version of Rails you wish.

Heroku does not specify any groups during bundle installation, so all gems from all groups will be bundled with your application.

Using Bundler from Rails 3
--------------------------

Rails 3 is built on top of Bundler. That means there is no setup needed, all gems specified on the Gemfile are ready for use on your app.
    
Using Bundler from Rails 2.3.5
------------------------------

Follow the instructions [here](http://gembundler.com/rails23.html).  Remember to remove all your "config.gem" lines from your environment configuration file!  Also remember to specify the your database gem as appropriate.

    :::term
    gem "pg"
    gem "sqlite3-ruby"
    
After you have added the code to your application, run

    :::term
    $ bundle install
    
And your app should now be using Gembundler.

Using Bundler from Sinatra or any Rack app
------------------------------------------

To use gems from your bundler environment under Sinatra or other non-Rails framework, add the following to the top of your app:

    :::ruby
    require "rubygems"
    require "bundler"
    Bundler.setup
