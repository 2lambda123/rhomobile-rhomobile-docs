Creating apps
=============

  * Each user has the ability to create multiple apps.
  * The app is the fundamental unit of ... well, everything.
  * Each app has its own PostgreSQL database, HTTP cache,
    and some number of dyno backends.
  * Apps are spread across Heroku's horizontally scaled *dyno grid*. You
    can run anywhere between 1 and 24 dynos.

[Installed the heroku command-line tool]

To create a new app named "myapp":

    $ heroku create myapp
    Created http://myapp.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:myapp.git

The name argument is optional. It's often easier to start with a default name
and rename it later. Since Heroku app names are in a global namespace, you can
expect that common names (like "blog" or "wiki") will already be taken.

### Viewing application information

    $ heroku info --app myapp
