Cron jobs
=========

If you have enabled either the nightly or hourly cron [addon](/addons), then Heroku will execute "rake cron" against your app during the given period.  You can use this to execute periodic background jobs by creating a file called `lib/tasks/cron.rake` and filling it in with your code.  For example, if you wanted to pull data from a news feed each night at midnight and put it into your database, you could create a task like this:

    {ruby}
    task :cron => :environment do
      if Time.now.hour == 0
        puts "Updating feed..."
        NewsFeed.nightly_update
        puts "done."
      end
    end

To see recent results of your cron execution, type:

    $ heroku logs:cron
