Cron jobs
=========

Once per hour, Heroku will execute "rake cron" against your app.  You can use this to execute periodic background jobs by creating a file called `lib/tasks/cron.rake` and filling it in with your code.  For example, if you wanted to pull data from a news feed each night at midnight and put it into your database, you could create a task like this:

    task :cron => :environment do
      if Time.now.hour == 0
        puts "Updating feed..."
        NewsFeed.nightly_update
        puts "done."
      end
    end

To see recent results of your cron execution, type:

    $ heroku logs:cron

NOTE: By default, a blank Rails app does not have the cron task defined, so you will see the message "Don't know how to build task 'cron'" as the output of `heroku logs:cron` on apps that have no cron task defined.  This is normal, and can safely be ignored.
