Cron jobs
=========

Enable the daily or hourly cron addon, and Heroku will execute "rake
cron" against your app, hourly for the hourly add-on, and once per 24 hour period with the daily add-on.  You can use this to
execute periodic background jobs by creating a file called
lib/tasks/cron.rake and filling it in with your code. Remember the
task is specified in Ruby code, so you can control the cron execution
by checking the current hour, for instance:

    :::ruby
    task :cron => :environment do
     if Time.now.hour % 4 == 0 # run every four hours
       puts "Updating feed..."
       NewsFeed.update
       puts "done."
     end
     if Time.now.hour == 0 # run at midnight
       User.send_reminders
     end
    end

To see recent results of your cron execution, type:

    :::term
    $ heroku logs:cron
