RhoHub Gallery and RhoGallery Tutorial
========
This tutorial will guide you through setting up a gallery on RhoHub and adding consumers, groups, and applications to it. 

It also shows how to install RhoGallery, which is the mobile app that consumers use to connect to a RhoHub gallery. It shows how to connect to a RhoHub gallery with the RhoGallery app, and how to install, run, and uninstall apps from a RhoHub gallery.

## Understanding RhoHub Galleries and RhoGallery

Frameworks such as Rhodes make it easy for developers to build native apps for all smartphones. However, developers need to get those apps to user's devices so users can test them. Enterprises with many mobile apps need to get the native apps out to all the enterprise users regardless of what kind of device the users have, need to manage who gets what apps, and need to update the apps for those users.

RhoGallery is a hosted app management solution. RhoGallery administrators can create galleries of apps, and they can invite consumers and groups of consumers to partake of those apps, and they can delete apps remotely. These apps can be Rhodes apps, or third party apps.

Note that the users of RhoGallery -- who install the RhoHub Gallery apps onto their mobile device using the RhoGallery mobile app -- are called consumers; this term of "consumers" is targeted at enterprise workers, to distinguish them from the RhoHub Gallery administrators.

The consumers receive an invite to a RhoGallery via SMS or email. The consumers then launch the RhoGallery app on their mobile device, and it will contain all the apps on RhoGallery for their company and job. And they will be able to organize and launch their enterprise apps from RhoGallery.
