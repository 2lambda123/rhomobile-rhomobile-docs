# Data Handling: The ORM Common API

This guide documents the [ORM common API](../api/NewORM), a new API released with RhoMobile Suite 5.3 that supports both JavaScript and Ruby languages. RMS 5.2 and earlier versions implemented database support for the languages in separate APIs: the original [Rhom API](../api/rhom-api) for Ruby apps and the [ORM API](../api/Orm), which integrates the [OPAL library](http://opalrb.org) to add JavaScript support to Rhom. 

These database APIs and documents are provided for RMS 5.3:

* [ORM Common API](../api/NewORM) and [ORM Common Model API](../api/NewORMModel) (support JavaScript and Ruby)
* [JavaScript ORM API](../api/Orm) and [JavaScript ORM Model API](../api/OrmModel) 
* [JavaScript Rhom Guide](rhom_js) 
* [Ruby Rhom API](../api/rhom-api) 
* [Ruby Rhom Guide](rhom_ruby)

The ORM Common API documented here exposes more methods to JavaScript than the ORM API, and is therefore recommended for building new JavaScript apps. 

## Why use ORM?
In general computing, [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) refers to the object-relational mapping technique that permits records of a relational database to be stored and retrieved programatically as objects. For RhoMobile, the ORM API provides a powerful high-level interface to an on-device SQLite database that can work alone or with the [RhoConnectClient](../api/RhoConnectClient) to enable two-way synchronization between your application and a RhoConnect server.

One of the main benefits of using an ORM is the simplicity it brings to database operations. Instead of having to write complex SQL statements by hand, an app can perform database actions by getting and setting properties on model objects. For example: 

Update a record with a SQL command:

    :::sql
    update product set price=119,brand='Symbol' where object='12345'

Update the same record with ORM:

    :::javascript
    product.updateAttibutes({price: 119, brand: "Symbol"});

Delete a record with SQL:

    :::sql
    delete from product where object='12345'

Delete an object with ORM:

    :::javascript
    product.destroy();

## What is a model?
In general, RhoMobile applications follow the [Model-View-Controller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) (MVC) pattern. In RhoMobile, a model can store information from two sources: 

* Data created or collected on the device
* Data retrieved from a RhoConnect synchronization server

Each model contains attributes (aka 'fields') that store information relating to that model. For example, a `Product` model might have the attributes of `name`, `brand` and `price`. Applications will normally have a model for each entity that they handle (i.e. `Customer`, `Product`, `Invoice`, `InvoiceLine`, `Order`, `LineItem`, etc).

RhoMobile apps can use two kinds of models: 

* Property Bag
* Fixed Schema

Each model type has advantages and disadvantages depending on the application.

## Property Bag Model

In the property bag model, data is stored as key-value pairs in a single table using the object-attribute-value or [entity-attribute-value model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity-attribute-value_model). This model is sometimes referred to as 'open schema' because the fields (or keys) do not have to be defined in advance; the API stores and syncs all key-value pairs that are entered.

### Advantages
* Simple, doesnâ€™t require advance attribute design 
* Attributes can be added or removed without modifying the database schema
* Requires no data migration following a schema change 

### Disadvantages
* Since all attributes are indexed, the database can be much larger than with fixed schema 
* Sync process can be slower because database insertions are performed at the attribute level

## Fixed Schema Model

In a fixed schema model, each model has a separate database table and attributes exist as columns in that table. In this sense, the fixed schema model is similar to a traditional relational database.

### Advantages
* Smaller database size; indexes can be assigned to specific attributes
* Sync process may be faster because whole objects are inserted at once

### Disadvantages
* Schema changes require data migration
* Database performance may be slow without careful index specificity

## How to Specify the ORM API
By default, RhoMobile apps will be built to use the 'ORM API' (JavaScript). To specify a one of the other two object-relational mapping APIs, add the following line to the application's `rhoconfig.txt` file: 

    :::yaml
    use_new_orm = 1  

Possible Values: 

* **1 (default)**
* 0 (use 'old' ORM API)

## Database Encryption

If your application requires local (on-device) database encryption, enable it by setting a flag in `build.yml`:

    :::yaml
    encrypt_database: 1

**NOTE: Database encryption is not currently supported for applications that use bulk sync.**

### Platform Notes
* iOS: Uses AES 128 encryption algorithm from iOS SDK.
* Android: Uses AES 128 ecryption algorithm from Android SDK.
* Windows Mobile: Uses RC4 algorithm from Windows Mobile SDK.


**NOTE: [Rhom data encryption](../../2.2.0/rhodes/rhom#database-encryption) is no longer available as of Rhodes 3.3.3 and higher. This feature is now supported only in Zebra RhoMobile Suite and requires the purchase of a [RhoElements license](licensing).**
