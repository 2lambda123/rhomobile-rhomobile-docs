# Build for Windows

## Setup
Follow the instructions for [setting up the development environment](nativesdksetup#setup-for-windows-desktop) for building Windows applications.

## Build application from the command line

Make sure that Visual Studio 2012 (or 2008) is installed and `VS110COMNTOOLS` (or `VS90COMNTOOLS`) environment variable is defined and points to the correct location, e.g. to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\Tools`, and that path to `msbuild.exe` (or to `vcbuild.exe`, something like `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\vcpackages`) is in your PATH env variable.

Also check that the vcbuild path is shown in the rhobuild.yml file. The rhobuild.yml file is located in the Rhodes folder (example location: `C:/RhoStudio/ruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/rhodes-4.1.0`).

If you use Visual Studio 2008 :

  env:
    paths:
      vcbuild: C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/VC/vcpackages/vcbuild.exe

If you use Visual Studio 2008 on 64-bit installations:

  env:
    paths:
      vcbuild: C:/Program Files (x86)/Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0/VC/vcpackages/vcbuild.exe

If you use Visual Studio 2012 : add path to `msbuild` to `rhobuild.yml` in rhodes folder:

  env:
    paths:
      vcbuild: msbuild

To build and run the application issue command:

  :::term
  $ rake run:win32

*NOTE: To use `rake run:win32` command, add to the `PATH` variable: `<path-to-rhodes>\lib\extensions\openssl.so\ext\win32\bin` (or `<path-to-rhodes>\lib\extensions\openssl.so\ext\win32\msvc2008\bin` if you use Visual Studio 2008)

To clean all temporary and binary files execute command:

  :::term
  $ rake clean:win32

## Create application installer for Windows

Download [NSIS installer tool](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download).

Add path to NSIS complier to 'rhobuild.yml' in rhodes folder:

On 32-bit platform:

    env:
      paths:
        nsis: C:/Program Files/NSIS/makensis.exe

On 64-bit platform:

    env:
      paths:
        nsis: C:/Program Files (x86)/NSIS/makensis.exe

### Readme, license and icon
* Application License can be provided by application developer. If file with LICENSE.txt name exists in the root of application folder when Installer will display separate page to confirm the license.
* Application Readme file can be provided by application developer. If file with README.html name exists in the root of application folder when Installer will display show readme at the final page of the Installer
* Application Icon should be used for Installer and application exe

To build installer bundle use command:

  :::term
  $ rake device:win32:production 

There is separate rake command for Windows XP Embedded platform. To build installer bundle use command:

  :::term
  $ rake device:winxpe:production 

After the build process is finished you can find the installer bundle named `<application-name>-setup.exe` in `<application-root>/bin/target/win32` folder.

## Logging

Rholog.txt is placed in `<rhodes folder>\platform\wm\bin\win32\rhodes\Debug\rho`

## How to enable HTTPS protocol

### Visual Studio 2012

First of all you may [download our build of the Qt binaries](http://rhomobile-suite.s3.amazonaws.com/Qt/Qt5-rhoxp.7z) that we use in our development process and in production builds of RhoSimulator. Exctract downloaded archive to `C:\Qt` (`Qt5-rhoxp` folder will be created) and set `QTDIR` system variable to `C:\Qt\Qt5-rhoxp`.

NOTE: You may use our precompiled binaries of Qt libraries for development and testing, but your production builds may require your own build of Qt libraries (you need to consult with Qt and OpenSSL license agreements to begin with).

So, if your application needs HTTPS or Windows XP compatibility, then you need to build the Qt libraries for Visual Studio 2012 as described below:

* If Python 2.6 or 2.7 is not installed on your system, download and install [Python 2.7](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.6/python-2.7.6.msi) (16 Mb)
* If Perl 5 is not installed on your system, download and install [Perl 5.16](http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePerl/releases/5.16.3.1603/ActivePerl-5.16.3.1603-MSWin32-x86-296746.msi)
* Make sure that Perl, Ruby and Python are present at the beginning of the `PATH` variable, e.g. `C:\Perl\bin;C:\Ruby\bin;C:\Python;...`
* Download the [Qt 5.1.1 source](http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/5.1/5.1.1/single/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-5.1.1.zip) (280 MB) and extract the archive, e.g. into `C:\Qt\Qt5-src`
* Download the [ICU 52.1 source](http://download.icu-project.org/files/icu4c/52.1/icu4c-52_1-src.zip) (24 MB) and extract the archive, e.g. into `C:\Qt\icu`
* Open Control Panel » System » Advanced system settings » Environment Variables and then:
    * Create new (or update existing) system variable `QTDIR` = `C:\Qt\Qt5-ssl` (this will be the installation folder for the compiled Qt libraries)
    * To make command 'rake run:win32' work - Add to the `PATH` variable: `<path-to-rhodes>\lib\extensions\openssl.so\ext\win32\bin`
    * Either close all command prompts and Visual Studio instances, or reboot the computer so the new settings take effect.

* Open `C:\Qt\icu\source\allinone\allinone.sln` solution in Visual Studio 2012 and:
    * Agree to update all projects to VS2012 toolset
    * Select projects from `cal` down to `makeconv`, select Project -> Properties from top menu, select Configuration = "All Configurations", Platform = "Win32", go to Configuration Properties -> General, set "Visual Studio 2012 - Windows XP (v110_xp)" in Platform Toolset field, and click Apply
    * Select projects from `pkgdata` down to `uconv`, repeat the previous step, and close the Properties window
    * Select configuration `Release` with platform `Win32` in the toolbar and build the solution, close Visual Studio 2012 after build is finished

* Patch Qt source code to make it Windows XP compatible:
    * Open `C:\Qt\Qt5-src\qtbase\qmake\Makefile.win32` file in text editor and add `-D_USING_V110_SDK71_` option to `CFLAGS_BARE` variable (e.g. at line 44 after `-DUNICODE`)
    * Open `C:\Qt\Qt5-src\qtbase\mkspecs\win32-msvc2012\qmake.conf` and:
        * Add `-D_USING_V110_SDK71_` option to `QMAKE_CFLAGS` variable (line 24)
        * Change `QMAKE_LFLAGS_CONSOLE` variable (at line 72) to `/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE,5.01`
        * Change `QMAKE_LFLAGS_WINDOWS` variable (at line 73) to `/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS,5.01`

* Create `C:\Qt\Qt5-build` folder and in that folder create new `build.bat` file with the following content (change the paths according to your system setup and folders you have extracted the archives into):

      call "%VS110COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x86
      set CL=/MP /D_USING_V110_SDK71_ %CL%
      set PATH=%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\7.1A\Bin;%PATH%
      set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Qt\icu\bin;C:\Qt\Qt5-src\gnuwin32\bin
      set INCLUDE=%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\7.1A\Include;%INCLUDE%
      set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;C:\Qt\icu\include
      set LIB=%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\7.1A\Lib;%LIB%
      set LIB=%LIB%;C:\Qt\icu\lib
      mkdir qtbase\include\QtZlib
      copy C:\Qt\Qt5-src\qtbase\include\QtZlib\*.h qtbase\include\QtZlib
      mkdir qtbase\src\3rdparty\zlib
      copy C:\Qt\Qt5-src\qtbase\src\3rdparty\zlib\*.h qtbase\src\3rdparty\zlib
      call ..\Qt5-src\configure.bat -opensource -confirm-license ^
       -prefix C:/Qt/Qt5-ssl -debug-and-release -platform win32-msvc2012 -mp ^
       -icu -shared -c++11 -make libs -nomake tests -nomake examples -angle ^
       -qt-zlib -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-freetype -openssl-linked ^
       -I <path-to-rhodes>/lib/extensions/openssl.so/ext/win32/include ^
       -L <path-to-rhodes>/lib/extensions/openssl.so/ext/win32/lib
      nmake
      nmake install
      nmake clean
      copy C:\Qt\icu\bin\icudt52.dll C:\Qt\Qt5-ssl\bin\
      copy C:\Qt\icu\bin\icuin52.dll C:\Qt\Qt5-ssl\bin\
      copy C:\Qt\icu\bin\icuuc52.dll C:\Qt\Qt5-ssl\bin\
      copy "%VS110COMNTOOLS%..\..\VC\bin\D3Dcompiler_46.dll" C:\Qt\Qt5-ssl\bin\

* Open Visual Studio 2012 Command Prompt. This is accomplished using `VS2012 x86 Native Tools Command Prompt` in Apps view of Windows 8 OS. To build Qt libraries run in Visual Studio 2012 Command Prompt:

      > C:
      > cd \Qt\Qt5-build
      > build.bat

  Be aware that it will take a while to build the Qt libraries from sources (maybe few hours or even a day).
* After the build process is completed exit Visual Studio 2012 Command Prompt

Now when you build your application the usual way, the HTTPS protocol support will be enabled automatically.

### Visual Studio 2008

If your application needs HTTPS, then you need to build the Qt libraries for Visual Studio 2008 with OpenSSL as described below:

* Download the [Qt 4.8.5 source](http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/qt/4.8/4.8.5/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.5.zip) (269 MB) and extract the archive, e.g. into `C:\Qt\4.8.5-src`
* Open Control Panel » System » Advanced system settings » Environment Variables and then:
    * Create new (or update existing) system variable `QTDIR` = `C:\Qt\4.8.5` (this will be the installation folder for the compiled Qt libraries)
    * To make command 'rake run:win32' work - Add to the `PATH` variable: `<path-to-rhodes>\lib\extensions\openssl.so\ext\win32\msvc2008\bin`
    * Either close all command prompts and Visual Studio instances, or reboot the computer so the new settings take effect.
* Open Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt. This is accomplished using Start » All Programs » Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 » Visual Studio Tools » Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt. To build Qt library run in Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt:

      > vcvarsall.bat x86
      > C:
      > cd \Qt\4.8.5-src
      > configure -opensource -platform win32-msvc2008
        -nomake examples -nomake demos -nomake docs
        -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-libtiff -qt-libmng -qt-gif
        -openssl-linked -no-qt3support -prefix C:/Qt/4.8.5
        -I <path-to-rhodes>/lib/extensions/openssl.so/ext/win32/include
        -L <path-to-rhodes>/lib/extensions/openssl.so/ext/win32/msvc2008/lib
      > nmake
      > nmake install
      > nmake clean

  Be aware that it will take a while to build the Qt libraries from sources (maybe few hours or so). Particularly the `configure` command may run for a few minutes, and the `nmake` command may run for a few hours.
* After the build process is completed exit Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt

Now when you build your application the usual way, the HTTPS protocol support will be enabled automatically.
