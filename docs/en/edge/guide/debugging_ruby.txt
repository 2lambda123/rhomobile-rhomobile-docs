# Debugging Ruby

## Debugging Ruby with RhoSimulator
You can use RhoSimulator along with RhoStudio debugger to debug the Ruby code in your RhoMobile application.

### Starting a debug session

Ensure that your application is configured properly and successfully runs in [RhoSimulator from the command line](#running-rhosimulator-from-command-line)

* In RhoStudio, select your RhoMobile project from the Project Explorer.
* Select 'Run' -> 'Debug Configurations' from the main menu. The Debug Configurations window appears.
* Find 'RhoMobile Application' section on the left and add new (or modify existing) configuration
* Select the required platform.
* Click 'Debug' to start the debugger.

RhoStudio will, by default, switch to the 'Debug' perspective, and it will establish a connection with RhoSimulator so that you can:

* Set breakpoints.
* Step through code.
* Inspect variables when the application is stopped at a breakpoint in the Variables window.
* View log messages in the Console window.
