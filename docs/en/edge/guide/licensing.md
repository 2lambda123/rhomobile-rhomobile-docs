# Licensing

Licensing in 4.2 has changed quite a lot, the most significant of these changes being the requirement that building any app what-so-ever requires that you have a subscription from our [rhomobile.com](www.rhomobile.com) site. This does not meant that you are required to pay in order to build an app as we have a free subscription level to use for local app builds. Let's go over what is involved in subscribing and building an app locally.

## Subscriptions
New to 4.2 we are introducing a subscription model for licensing for our products. The new licensing structure has three levels: Free, Silver, and Gold. The details of these plans are listed below.

NOTE: This does mean that without a paid subscription your usage of RhoMobile products is limited to Rhodes and RhoStudio for local builds only.

## Applying Your Subscription Token
Once you have signed up for a subscription on [rhomobile.com](www.rhomobile.com), you'll need to apply your new token to your copy of RhoStudio or through the command line. This will be automatically asked for when you first try to build an app using the 4.2 version of Rhodes.

Once you have applied your license you are free to build apps.
