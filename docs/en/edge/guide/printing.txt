# Printing

### Printing on iOS
iOS include printing support. You should prepare File for printing and open it by standart platform - use:
	:::ruby
	System.open_url(file_full_path)

We recommend prepare PDF. You can use PDF-Writer pure Ruby library for it - we include it into rhodes - just include "pdf-writer" and "thread" extensions to your application extension list in build.yml :
	:::yaml
	extensions: ["pdf-writer", "thread"] 

See example in our [System API Samples application Generate PDF example](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/tree/master/app/GeneratePDF/controller.rb) application.


### Printing on Android
Android do not support printing. You can use any third-party application for printing, for example Google Cloud Print application for print by using of Google Cloud Print web service.
You should prepare file for printing and open it by standart platform - use:
	:::ruby
	System.open_url(file_full_path)
Android platform opens that file in application registered for file extension or show select dialog for manually choose application if there are more than one application registered for this extension.

We recommend prepare PDF. You can use PDF-Writer pure Ruby library for it - we include it into rhodes - just include "pdf-writer" and "thread" extensions to your application extension list in build.yml.
	:::yaml
	extensions: ["pdf-writer", "thread"] 

See example in our [System API Samples application Generate PDF example](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/tree/master/app/GeneratePDF/controller.rb) application.
