# Welcome to RhoMobile Hosted Services
The RhoMobile.com product suite provides access to two main hosted services: remote build and app management. To use these features, you must have a paid subscription through [Rhomobile.com](http://www.rhomobile.com/pricing.html) (either silver or gold). 

## Remote Build
The RhoMobile framework allows you to quickly create and build applications for multiple smart-phone operating systems. Remote build makes building RhoMobile applications even easier, reducing the overhead of getting started and as well as streamlining ongoing development efforts.

For more information on remote build, head over to our [remote build tutorial](remote-build-tutorial).
