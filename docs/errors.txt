Error Pages
===========

Errors happen. Knowing how to distinguish between a problem with the Heroku
platform and an error in your application can save you time and effort in
getting to the source of the problem and restoring service. Heroku takes
advantage of the HTTP response's status code to convey information about
different classes of errors:

### Internal Server Error (HTTP 500)

This indicates an error inside your application. Common causes would be gem dependency, syntax and argument errors. Use "heroku logs" to diagnose the problem, and implement a fix.

### App Failed To Respond (HTTP 502)

When you see an HTTP 502 error it means your app failed to properly respond to communication from the Heroku platform. In this case, you will see one of the following three pages:

#### App Failed to Boot

If your app failed to start up, a 502 status is returned with a page displaying
the app's crashlog.  Use the backtrace to locate the problem (typically a
missing gem, or a bad line in your config somewhere) and push a fix.

#### App Crashed

If your app crashes unexpectedly due to an uncaught exception, or perhaps broken code injected at runtime, you will see an "App Crashed" page.

NOTE: While your app is crashed, you can still run rake tasks via
`heroku rake`, but console commands are not possible.

#### App Failed to Respond

Occasionally an app may issue a zero-length response. Often, this type of error is memory related. While Ruby handles memory errors gracefully, this is not always the case for gems with native extensions. A native extension exceeding the dyno memory limit can cause this error.

#### Request Timeout

This page is shown when your dyno takes more than 30 seconds to respond to a request. Check our [Performance page](performance#request-timeout) for more info on how to avoid request timeouts.

### Backlog Too Deep (HTTP 504)

Your dyno(s) cannot keep up with the current request volume. See the [Performance](performance#backlog-too-deep) page for more info.

### Maintenance Mode (HTTP 422)

Your app has been put in [maintenance mode](maintenance-mode).

### Heroku Ouchie Page (HTTP 503)

In the event of a Heroku platform error or system outage, an HTTP 503 status code is returned with an *Ouchie Guy*, like this:

This specific error code indicates that something is wrong with Heroku, and not with your app. If the problem persists,
please [open a support ticket](http://support.heroku.com/) or send an email
to [support@heroku.com](mailto:support@heroku.com).
