Error Pages
===========

Errors happen. Knowing how to distinguish between a problem with the Heroku
platform and an error in your application can save you time and effort in
getting to the source of the problem and restoring service. Heroku takes
advantage of the HTTP response's status code to convey information about
different classes of errors:

### Heroku Ouchie Page (HTTP 503)

In the event of a Heroku platform error or system outage, an HTTP 503 status
code is returned with an *Ouchie Guy*, like this:

<img src="/images/ouchie.png" width='484' height='130'>

This indicates that something is wrong with Heroku. If the problem persists,
please [open a support ticket](http://support.heroku.com/) or send an email
to [support@heroku.com](mailto:support@heroku.com).

### App failed to boot (HTTP 502)

If your app failed to start up, a 502 status is returned with a page displaying
the app's crashlog.  Use the backtrace to locate the problem (typically a
missing gem, or a bad line in your config somewhere) and push a fix.

Note that while your app is crashed, you can still run rake tasks via
`heroku rake`, but console commands are not possible.

### Other errors

Error codes other than a 503 points to a problem within your application. Check
your logs and/or exception monitoring service for info on what went wrong.
