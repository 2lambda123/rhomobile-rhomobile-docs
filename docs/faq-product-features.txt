Platform Features
====================

How does database scaling work?
---------------------------

Heroku can scale your PostgreSQL database vertically. Switching between plans within our shared database tier is instant and seamless. All that changes is the amount of allocated database storage. Switching to/from a dedicated database usually takes one business day as our support staff processes the requests, and verifies that data migrations completed successfully.

How does dyno scaling work?
---------------------------

There are three ways to scale your dynos: with the slider on the resources page for your app, using the heroku command-line client or directly through the API. Either way, changes are almost instant - it only takes a few seconds to deploy your requested number into the [dyno grid](http://heroku.com/how/dyno_grid). Also, dynos are billed by the hour ($0.05/hour), so if you want to experiment with different configurations, you can do so and only be billed for actual dyno hours consumed. Remember, it's your responsibility to set the correct number of dynos for your app.

Do you support MySQL?
--------------------

We support MySQL through [Amazon RDS](http://aws.amazon.com/rds). Use the free [Amazon RDS add-on](http://addons.heroku.com/amazon_rds) to easily connect your Heroku apps to your Amazon RDS instances.

Can I point *.mydomain.com to my Heroku app?
--------------------------------------------

Yes, use our [Wildcard Domains add-on](http://addons.heroku.com/custom_domains). Note that this requires the free Custom Domains add-on to also be installed.

Why does SSL cost $100/month?
-----------------------------

SSL was designed before cloud computing. The original implementation requires that each domain have it’s own dedicated IP address. Amazon EC2 doesn’t have a mechanism to have multiple IP addresses connected to a single instance, meaning that Heroku must spin up a dedicated instance for each domain using SSL.

SNI was designed to address this issue, and is the best way to support SSL in a cloud architecture. Unfortunately, Microsoft has decided to not support SNI on Windows XP. Until Vista/Windows 7 has major market penetration, for users requiring broad browser compatibility Custom SSL is the only viable option. We are providing an expensive option in favor of none at all, while we work with Amazon to provide cheaper alternatives.

Do you offer an outgoing email service?
---------------------------------------

Yes, through the [Sendgrid add-on](http://addons.heroku.com/sendgrid). The free version will allow you to send 200 emails per day from your app, and the paid version allows 30,000 emails per month for $20. If you need a higher volume Sendgrid plan, please contact biz@heroku.com. You can also use GMail SMTP, following the instructions at http://bit.ly/21AfKq.

How do I install gems for my app?
---------------------------------

Almost any gem - even those with native dependencies - can be installed using a [gem manifest](http://docs.heroku.com/gems). If there's a specific gem that won't install on Heroku, please [submit a support ticket](http://support.heroku.com/tickets/new).

Does my app have a static IP?
-----------------------------

No. With multiple dynos, your app is distributed across several nodes in our grid. Access and routing to individual dynos is always controlled by our [routing mesh](http://heroku.com/how/architecture#routing-mesh), and goes through our [public IPs]((http://docs.heroku.com/custom-domains#root-domains-and-custom-mail-servers)). While you can never access a dyno directly by IP, it is possible to originate outgoing requests directly from a dyno. However, do not count on the dyno's IP being static. We actively monitor our grid, and frequently move dynos around to ensure optimal reliability and performance.
