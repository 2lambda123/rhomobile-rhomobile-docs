Frequently Asked Questions
===

This page describes how to perform various functions using the Rhodes / RhoSync frameworks and RhoHub.

## How do I write "Hello, world" in Rhodes?
Edit the `app/index.erb` to create some content:
	
	:::html
	<div class="toolbar">
	  <h1 id="pageTitle">
	    Small demo app
	  </h1>
	</div>

	<ul id="home" selected="true" title="Hello">
	  <li><a href="another.erb">Hello, world which links to another page</a></li>
	</ul>

## I don't know Ruby.  Why don't you teach us Ruby in your tutorials?
As shown in the above example and tutorials you can do a lot without knowing much Ruby.  But you can build much more sophisticated apps with some Ruby knowledge.  There are many great Ruby tutorials out there and we could probably not improve on them.  One of them is [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/).

## How do I add an OK button to my app?
The generated code from running (`rhodes model <modelname> <attributelist>`) contains several samples. Here's a smaller fragment.
	 
	:::html
	<form method="POST" action="<%= url_for(:action =>:update) %>">
	<input type="submit" value="OK"/>
	</form>

## How do I insert a picture icon next to an element?
Adding to the above example:
	
	:::html
	<ul id="home" selected="true" title="Hello">
	  <li><a href="another.erb"><img src="/public/images/bluebutton.png"></a></li>
	</ul>

## How do I call a web service and process the returned data?

This is done with [`AsyncHttp`](/rhodes/connect-to-web-services).  You will then use either JSON (if its a JSON web service) or REXML (if the web service returns XML) to process the data. 

See the [`AsyncHttp` example code](/rhodes/connect-to-web-services#asynchttp-example) which connects to an XML feed at <a href="http://rhostore.heroku.com/products.xml"/> and parses it with rexml.

## How do I make a POST request to webservice?
To make a POST request, use the `AsyncHttp.post` method.  See the [`AsyncHttp.post` docs here](/rhodes/connect-to-web-services#asynchttp-api).


## Can I process XML with Rhodes?
Yes, first add the following to your `build.yml`:

	:::yaml
	extensions: ["rexml", "set"]

Now parse the xml in your controller action:

	:::ruby
	require 'rexml/document'
	file = File.new("bibliography.xml")
	doc = REXML::Document.new(file)
	puts doc

If you are planning to run your app on Blackberry, you should use the [`RhoXml` extension](/rhodes/extensions#rhodes-extensions). It has the same syntax as rexml, but has limited functionality and a much smaller memory footprint.  Enable it in your application by adding to `build.yml`:

	:::ruby
  	extensions: ["rhoxml"]

Now parse the xml in your controller action:
	require 'rexml/document'
	file = File.new("bibliography.xml")
	doc = REXML::Document.new(file)
	puts doc

If you have a very large XML document to parse, you should use the [XML stream parser extension](/rhodes/extensions#rhodes-extensions).

## How can I seed a large amount of data into my application with Rhom?
You can either use the [built-in Rhom functions](/rhodes/rhom#seeding-the-database) or use a database transaction:

	:::ruby
	db = ::Rho::RHO.get_src_db('Model')
	db.start_transaction
	begin
	  items.each do |item|
		# create hash of attribute/value pairs
	    data = {
		  :field1 => item['value1'], 
		  :field2 => item['value2'] 
		} 
		# Creates a new Model object and saves it
	    new_item = Model.create(data)
	  end
	 db.commit
	rescue
	 db.rollback
	end

## How do I customize the app name and icons?
Follow the [build section on setting the application name and icon](/rhodes/build#how-to-set-application-name-and-icon).

## What about Rhodes/RhoSync and security?
There are three main points with synchronized data smartphone apps and security:

*  Securing data over the wire

	Just as with an Objective C or Android Java app, you will transmit the data over SSL (https).  Both Rhodes alone and Rhodes plus RhoSync support use of https as a transport. In fact it is easier with Rhodes than with Objective C. You just list an https URL and Rhodes will connect to the backend appropriately. This is in contrast to underlying SDKs where significantly different code is written to connect to an https URL.

* Storing encrypted data on the device

    [Database Encryption](/rhodes/rhom#database-encryption)

* Authentication

	There needs to be authentication to some form of directory for optimal sync server security.  RhoSync makes it very easy to perform authentication by simply providing an "authenticate" method that can call to any directory authority. A typical authenticate method is less than five lines of code.
	
	There is also the issue of how does RhoSync authenticate with your backend service each time an adapter is executed.  This is done via the "login" method in the source adapter.

## How to improve application perfomance on Blackberry?
* Before test application for perfomance set warning log level in rhoconfig.txt:

        MinSeverity = 3
    
* Database is most critical part for perfomance improvement. See [Database Perfomance Tips](/rhodes/rhom#perfomance-tips)
* If possible, do not use images in html body(single or tiled) - use solid color
* If possible, do not use Exceptions to implement application logic. Add check for null parameters instead of catch Exception.
* If possible, do not use Date/Time parse method. Use strptime instead. Use time as number when possible
* Move require of big ruby files to methods when they used. This is true for locally used classes. Add system check for platform dependent code.
* Exclude unused files from build(images, libraries etc). It will decrease application size and improve startup perfomance.Edit build.yml:
      excludedirs: 
      bb: 
      - public/images/iphone
      - public/images/android
