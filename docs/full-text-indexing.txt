Full text indexing
==================

For apps with small datasets to be indexed, we recommend acts_as_ferret, which is quick to setup and has no external dependencies, but is limited in how far it can scale.  For apps with large datasets, we recommend Solr, which will require setup of an external server.

Ferret
------

Heroku has the Ferret and acts_as_ferret gems installed by default.  By default, acts_as_ferret stores its indexes in a location that is not writeable for Heroku apps, so you'll need to add this bit of configuration to your environment.rb:

    require 'acts_as_ferret'
    ActsAsFerret.index_dir = "#{RAILS_ROOT}/tmp/index"

This will require rebuilding the indexes every time a new app server is launched, so it's not well-suited for large datasets.  But it's a good choice for getting off the ground quickly.

Solr
----

For large datasets, you can run a Solr server on your own EC2 instance (ideal for minimizing latency), or on any internet-connected server.  Steps to set up Solr:

* Install the Java runtime environment.  On Debian or Ubuntu this can be done with: apt-get install sun-java6-jre
* git clone git://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr.git
* cd acts_as_solr/solr && java -jar start.jar

The server will now be running on port 8983.  Test it with a web client, such as: curl localhost:8983, which should produce a 404.

Then to set up a Rails app to access it:

* script/plugin install git://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr.git
* Add acts_as_solr to the model.  Specify which fields you want to index - otherwise it will try to index everything, which may cause problems with date fields.  For example:
    acts_as_solr :fields => [ :title, :body ]
* Edit config/solr.yml and set production to use the IP of your Solr server and port 8983.
* Deploy your app to Heroku with git push.
* Run heroku rake solr:reindex to generate the index for any existing records in your database.
* Try it out with something like: heroku console "Post.find_by_solr('some text')"
