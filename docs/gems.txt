Installing Gems
===============

Every Heroku app includes a private gem repository that can be used to install
both pure-ruby gems and compiled extension gems. Gems available to an
application are determined by a simple `.gems` manifest file located in the root
of the application directory and versioned in the app's git repository like any
other file. When a new version of the app is pushed to Heroku, any changes to
the `.gems` file are detected and new gems are installed along with their
dependencies.

Using the `.gems` manifest has some distinct advantages over freezing gems under
an application's `vendor/gems` directory. Freezing gems can make your git
repository quite large, which slows down push and deploy operations. More
importantly, it's possible to install compiled extension gems via the manifest
file, whereas frozen vendor gems are limited to pure-ruby libraries.

Gem Manifest
------------

The `.gems` manifest is a simple text file that includes information about each
of the gems required by an application. Each entry in the manifest includes
a mandatory gem name along with optional `version` and `source` options. The
manifest format resembles the gem command line:

    GEM_NAME [--version VERSION] [--source SOURCE]
    ...

* `GEM_NAME` is the name of the gem as would be specified on the `gem install`
   command line.
* `VERSION` is an optional gem version specifier. This can be a basic version
   number like "0.1.2" or an advanced version specifier with comparison
   constraints like ">= 0.1.2"
   (see [Specifying Versions](http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/16) in the
   RubyGems manual for more information). When no explicit version is specified,
   the most recent version of the gem is installed.
* `SOURCE` is an optional gem repository URL like gems.rubyforge.org,
   gems.github.com, or gems.mycustomrepo.com. The gems.rubyforge.org repository
   is used when no explicit source is specified. Multiple `--source` arguments
   may be provided for cases where dependencies cross multiple repositories.

The following is an example `.gems` manifest file that includes four gems:

    hpricot --version '>= 0.2' --source code.whytheluckystiff.net
    dm-core --version 0.9.10
    rest-client
    pony

NOTE: The `--version` and `--source` options have short forms just like the
`gem` command; use `-v` and `-s`, respectively.

Deploying Gems
--------------

Once a `.gems` manifest file is created, it must be added to the app's git
repository and pushed to heroku. The actual gem install process occurs during
the `git push` operation. The push is aborted if the gem manifest is invalid or
a gem fails to install, ensuring that an application is not deployed in an
inconsistent state.

The following example adds a `.gems` file to the app's git repository, commits
it, and pushes to the remote heroku repository:

    $ git add .gems
    $ git commit -m 'added gems manifest file'
    $ git push heroku

    Compressing objects: 100% (5/5), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (7/7), 741 bytes, done.
