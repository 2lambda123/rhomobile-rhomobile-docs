# Apple App Store

## Setup native SDK for iOS

Follow the instructions for [setting up the development environment](/guide/nativesdksetup#setup-for-ios) for building iOS applications.

### Using RhoHub

Alternatively, you can create the device builds with RhoHub. RhoHub is a cloud based service that integrates with RhoStudio to allow building and packaging apps for all platforms.

You can use it:

* to avoid installing SDKs locally
* to quickly get you up and running
* for building and packaging for platforms that are not supported by your development computer, for example building iPhone apps from your Windows PC.

See the [RhoHub tutorial](/guide/rhohubtutorial) for more details.

## Configuring the production build

### Modifying the build.yml

First, in your applicationâ€™s build.yml file, change sdk to iphoneos instead of iphonesimulator, configuration to Release instead of Debug, and add information such as codesignidentity.

Here is an example of the iPhone settings in build.yml for a finished application:

    :::yaml
    iphone:
    name: JS App
    version: 1.0
    iphone: 
        provisionprofile: E5931D39-CA68-48E4-A3AF-BB538E1C8CE6 
        sdk: iphoneos4.2
        codesignidentity: "iPhone Developer: John Smith (MF99RW67WY)"
        entitlements: ""
        configuration: Release
        emulator: 4.2
        emulatortarget: ipad
        BundleIdentifier: com.johnsmithcompany.jsapp
        BundleURLScheme: jsapp

Refer to (/guide/build_ios#building-the-application-for-the-ios-device) for detailed list of settings used in `build.yml`.

## Creating the signed APP file

Once your `build.yml` is set up, you can run:

    :::term
    $ rake device:iphone:production

The signed package named `[app-name].app` will be created in `<app-dir>/bin/target/iOS/[sdkname]/[configuration]/`. You can upload the file to App Store.

## Publishing on App Store

To publish your app on Apple App Store you need a iOS Developer Program account. Goto the [Member center](http://developer.apple.com/membercenter) to create one.

Refer to the [App Store docs](https://developer.apple.com/appstore/) for further steps to distribute to Apple App Store.
