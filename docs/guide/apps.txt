# Run external application
Use System.open_url : you can provide any url with any schema(http, file etc), depending of platform will be run associated application to handle this url 
	:::ruby
	System.open_url('http://www.rhomobile.com')

Use rho_open_target=_blank in html link. Note that jQuery Mobile or other javascript library may disable this attribute.
	:::html
	<a href="http://www.google.com/?rho_open_target=_blank">Open Google in external browser</a>

### Sample
See CustomUri of [system API sample application](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/tree/master/app/CustomUri/controller.rb) for example.

## Run rhodes application from browser

### Android
On Android it is possible to start rhodes app from browser by http link or redirect response. It is also possible to register custom URI scheme for the app.
At Android the URI must strictly follow standard URI rules. Additionally Android Chrome browser makes additional restriction: the host part of the URI must be resolvable.
By default the http://rhomobile.com/com.vendor.appname URI format is used by Rhodes. You can add additional path and query parameters to the URI and handle it by application code.
It is possible to customize the URI with build.yml settings. Default Rhodes URI contains four parts:
- scheme
- host name
- path prefix
- optional path and query
You can customize scheme and host name parts with following build.yml parameters:
    :::ruby
    android:
        URIScheme: myapp
        URIHost: www.myhost.com
In case if URIHost is specified no path prefix will be used. If no custom URIHost then default one is used (rhomobile.com) and path prefix must contain java package name of your application.
Optional path and query just passed to your application for further processing.

**NOTE: Google recommends to always use common scheme such as 'http', 'https', 'ftp', etc.**

http scheme example:
    :::html
    <a href="http://rhomobile.com/com.rhomobile.rhodessystemapisamples">Open System API Samples</a>

Custom scheme examples:
    :::ruby
    android:
        URIScheme: rho

    :::html
    <a href="rho://rhomobile.com/com.rhomobile.rhodessystemapisamples">Open System API Samples</a>


    :::ruby
    android:
        URIScheme: rho-sas
        URIHost: rhomobile.com

    :::html
    <a href="rho-sas://rhomobile.com">Open System API Samples</a>

### iPhone
On iOS devices it is possible to start rhodes app by link with special registered URI scheme from browser. You should register custom URI scheme for the app.
Custom URI scheme is set up in build.yml then this scheme is used followed by any string.

Custom scheme example:
    :::ruby
    iphone:
        BundleURLScheme: myapp

    :::html
    <a href="myapp:string_with_params">Open MyApp application</a>

In application you can get start params by 
    :::ruby
    System.get_start_params()

For previous example start params will be "string_with_params".

For execute you rhodes based application from another rhodes based application use next code:
	:::ruby
	System.open_url('myapp:string_with_params')
