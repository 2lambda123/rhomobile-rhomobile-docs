# Build for Windows Phone 8

## Setup
Follow the instructions for [setting up the development environment](/guide/nativesdksetup#setup-for-windows-phone-8) for building Windows Phone 8 applications.

## Application changes
    
* Add to application build.yml productid GUID. For example:

        wp:
          productid: 632621d0-5ecb-012e-2c97-482a1411c191
NOTE: When you use rhodes command to generate application, productid is generated automatically

## Build and run using Rhodes gem

* Install Rhodes gem

* Run application simulator:

        $rake run:wp8

NOTE: You may use your computer keyboard with Windows Phone 8 emulator. By default it is disabled, but you can enable it pressing **PgUp** key. While it is enabled a device rotation simulation is not supported. To rotate device you need to disable keyboard support pressing **PgDown** key.  Look [MSDN page](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff754352(v=vs.92).aspx) for much more details on this topic.

* Run application device:

        $rake run:wp8:device

* See log in application folder : rholog.txt

NOTE: When running on device you may need to disconnect USB cable from device to see log

* After Application code modifications, run rake commands. DO NOT close simulator!
