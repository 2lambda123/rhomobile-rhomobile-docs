# Keylight

## What is Keylight

[Keylight](../rhoelements/Keylight) refers to the keyboard backlight functionality. You can turn On/Off the keyboard backlight as well as setting the intensity of the backlight.

NOTE: this functionality only applies to devices with hardware keyboards

## How to use Keylight

In the below example, we turn on the backlight and set the intensity to 3.

In Ruby, we can do this as follows:

    :::ruby
    Keylight.on
    Keylight.intensity = 3
    
The equivalent Javascript example would be

    :::html    
    keylight.on();
    keylight.intensity = 3;

## Example scenarios for using Keylight

* turn backlight On/Off in a cyclic manner as a form of Notification
* reduce/increase backlight intensity based on time of day or ambient light conditions.
