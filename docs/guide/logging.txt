# Logging
There are two methods to log messages. 

From any controller you can log using the methods app_info and app_error. These methods take a string and will write that to rholog.txt with the category of your controllers name. See platform specific [build topic](build) to see notes on how to get rholog.txt.

Call app_info and app_error from a method in your controller:

	:::ruby
	def index
		app_info "My info message"
		app_error "My error message"
	end

There also is a logging Ruby class called RhoLog. This class has methods info and error which take 2 strings. The first string is the category, the second string is the message.

The [RhoLog API](/rhodesapi/rholog-api) has methods to print error messages. Click the links below for detailed information about the methods.

 * [info](/rhodesapi/rholog-api#info) - Print an information message in the rholog.txt file.
 * [error](/rhodesapi/rholog-api#error) - Print an error message in the rholog.txt file. The message will have an “ERROR” prefix.

Call the RhoLog error or info methods from a method in your Rhodes app:

	:::ruby
	def index
		RhoLog.error("Some Category", "Some error message")
		RhoLog.info("Some Category", "Some info message")
	end

Additionally all common ruby output routines (like puts, print) are redirected to rhodes log with INFO level.

In rholog.txt the lines appear as follows:

	<Timestamp> <category> | <message>

To enable remote logging just add the line to `rhoconfig.txt`:

	rhologurl = 'http://<host>:<port>[/path]'

Then all log messages will be sent to the specified URL via POST HTTP-requests.

You can also send log to remote server manually: Log server address where log will be posted by using RhoConf.send_log or from the log view. Log server source code is open and available at <http://github.com/rhomobile/rhologs>, so you can deploy your own logserver.

Add the lines to `rhoconfig.txt`:

	logserver = 'http://rhologs.heroku.com'
	logname='helloworld'

Then call RhoConf.send_log:

	:::ruby
	def index
		Rho::RhoConf.send_log()
	end


See [Log Configuration](/rhodes/configuration#run-time-configuration) for all Logging configuration parameters.

## How see log messages from iOS device.

You have next ways for get log from iOS device :
 
1. See full console output
 
* open XCode
* open Organizer ("window" submenu in top menu)
* select "Devices" tab
* select your connected device in left panel
* select "Console"
  
2. Get the rholog.txt file from device 
 
* open XCode
* open Organizer ("window" submenu in top menu)
* select "Devices" tab
* select your connected device in left panel
* select "Applications"
* select your application and wait few seconds
* you can select local file in your application's local folder and download it to computer - use "Download" button in bottom panel
 
3. Send log to server from application



## RhoError class

You may find access to the error class useful in logging and reporting:

This class contains error codes and the method message() to translate error code to a text message.
All callbacks return an error code from this class. The status text in the callback contains some internal error message, so in most cases it should not be exposed to user.
Currently RhoError contains the following error codes:

	ERR_NONE = 0
	ERR_NETWORK = 1
	ERR_REMOTESERVER = 2
	ERR_RUNTIME = 3
	ERR_UNEXPECTEDSERVERRESPONSE = 4
	ERR_DIFFDOMAINSINSYNCSRC = 5
	ERR_NOSERVERRESPONSE = 6
	ERR_CLIENTISNOTLOGGEDIN = 7
	ERR_CUSTOMSYNCSERVER = 8
	ERR_UNATHORIZED = 9
