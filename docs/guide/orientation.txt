# Screen rotation
When user rotate device, Rhodes update view corresponding to new orientation. To get notification about rotation use callback:
	:::ruby
	System.set_screen_rotation_notification(callback, params) 

Callback will be called when screen has rotated (available since Rhodes 2.0).
Callback parameters are:
- width - new screen width
- height - new screen height
- degrees - screen rotation relative to portrait position

NOTE: On tablet devices with default landscape form factor degrees value in normal position will be 90

### Sample
See controller and view in the /app/ScreenRotation folder of the [System API Samples application](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/tree/master/app/ScreenRotation/controller.rb) for more information.
