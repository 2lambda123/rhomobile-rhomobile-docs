#Welcome To RhoMobile Suite

Motorola’s RhoMobile Suite provides developers the best of all worlds for building cross platform enterprise applications. Most often, there is hesitation around developing cross platform applications because of the concern that certain features will be lost or cannot replicate properly in a non-native environment. Developers now have a choice of using Ruby or Javascript for accessing device capabilities. These cross platform applications can be delivered to the device as a native application, or existing web applications can be extended to provide RhoMobile features. 

##RhoStudio
A powerful Eclipse plug-in that allows you to develop, test and debug your RhoMobile applications. Runs on both a Windows PC or Mac and includes RhoSimulator, a device and platform simulator customized for your RhoMobile application development.

##RhoMobile
RhoMobile is the mobile application container that runs as a true native application but allows you to easily write cross code by using common web skills. In addition to supporting standard web languages like Javascript, HTML, CSS and Ruby, RhoMobile provides device, system and framework access through it's Rhodes and RhoElements API libraries. RhoMobile applications come with a RhoConnect client for easy integration with a RhoConnect application to provide data synchronization.

###Rhodes
Rhodes is a API library set that is accesible to all RhoMobile applications. It provides access via both Javascript and Ruby interfaces and allows developers to access device level capabilities like Camera or Locationing. Rhodes is free to use, open-source and developers can contribute to the project.  

###RhoElements
RhoElements is an additional API library set that is accessible to RhoMobile applications and is optimized and customized to run on Motorola Solutions devices. It provides access via both Javascript and Ruby programming languages and allows developers access to an extended set of device capabilities like Bar Code Scanning and hardware capabililities that are only provided on eterprise level mobile devices. 

##RhoConnect
RhoConnect is a server application that either can be hosted on our system or yours and acts as a seamless bridge for your enterprise data to exist both on your backend and your mobile device. With RhoConnect, you can simultaneously connect your application to many data sources just as easily as you can connect to one data source — including enterprise back-end customer relationship management (CRM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, web services, databases and much more. 

##RhoHub
Package apps for all platforms without installing SDKs locally, including iPhone apps from your Windows PC. RhoHub is a cloud based platform that itergrates with RhoStudio to provide seemless local coding and building in the cloud to quickly get you up and running.

##RhoGallery 
Unlike other mobile management solutions RhoGallery focuses just on the apps and data for enterprise users. RhoGallery let's you easily deploy your applications to your mobile devices whether they are RhoMobile applications or native applications using your personal App Store. This makes the solution easier to use and cheaper to operate.
