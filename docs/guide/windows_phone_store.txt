# Windows Phone Store

## Setup native SDK for Windows Phone 8

Follow the instructions for [setting up the development environment](/guide/nativesdksetup#setup-for-windows-phone-8) for building Windows Phone 8 applications.

### Using RhoHub

Alternatively, you can create the device builds with RhoHub. RhoHub is a cloud based service that integrates with RhoStudio to allow building and packaging apps for all platforms.

You can use it:

* to avoid installing SDKs locally
* to quickly get you up and running
* for building and packaging for platforms that are not supported by your development computer, for example building iPhone apps from your Windows PC.

See the [RhoHub tutorial](/guide/rhohubtutorial) for more details.

## Configuring the production build

### Modifying the build.yml

Update your application's `build.yml` to include productid GUID. 

For example:

    :::yaml
    wp:
        productid: 632621d0-5ecb-012e-2c97-482a1411c191

## Creating the XAP file

Once your `build.yml` is set up, you can run:

    :::term
    $ rake device:wp8:production

## Publishing on Windows Phone Store
    
To publish your app on Windows Phone Store you need a [Windows Phone Dev Center account](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/join).

Refer to the docs at the [Windows Phone Dev Center](http://developer.windowsphone.com/en-us/publish) for further steps to publish to the Windows Phone Store.
