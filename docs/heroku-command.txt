Using The `heroku` Command
==========================

The Heroku gem provides a command-line wrapper to the Heroku API.

Running `heroku` without any arguments will show usage. Commands are divided
into two types: general commands, and those that run against a specific app.

General Commands
----------------

General commands operate on your Heroku account as a whole, and are not specific
to a particular app.

To get a list of apps you have created or are a collaborated on:

    $ heroku list
    myapp
    anotherapp
    thirdapp

To create a new app:

    $ heroku create myapp
    Created http://myapp.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:myapp.git

The name argument is optional.  It's often easier to start with a default name
and rename it later.  Since Heroku app names are in a global namespace, you can
expect that common names (like "blog" or "wiki") will already be taken.

App commands
------------

App commands are typically executed inside a git clone checkout of the app.  The
heroku command gleans the app name by looking in `.git/config` for your remote.
So if you've added the remote as described in the Quickstart, or if you've
cloned it from Heroku, you should `cd` into the checkout directory before
running a command.

So the info command needs no arguments inside the checkout:

    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku info
    Web URL:        http://myapp.heroku.com/
    Git Repo:       git@heroku.com:myapp.git
    Collaborators:  you@example.com

If you wish to run a command without a checkout of the app, any of the app
commands can take the `--app` argument.

    $ heroku info --app myapp

You can also give the custom domain for the app:

    $ heroku info --app www.example.com
