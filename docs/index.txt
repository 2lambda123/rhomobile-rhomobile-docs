Heroku Documentation
====================

__Heroku is a platform for instant deployment of Ruby/Rails web apps.__

Heroku is a completely novel approach to deploying web applications.
Forget about servers; the fundamental unit is the app.  Use the Heroku client
gem to create and manage apps from the command line.  Then deploy your code with
Git, and control the running app with the remote Ruby console and rake
commands.

All users should start with [the quickstart guide](/quickstart).

Then after you've deployed your first app, check out these goodies:

* [Remote console and rake](/console-rake)
* [Installing gems](/gems)
* [Using your own domain name](/custom-domains)
* [Deploying a Merb or Sinatra app](/rack)
* [Import an existing database](/taps)
