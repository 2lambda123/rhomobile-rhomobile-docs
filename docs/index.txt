Heroku Documentation
====================

__Heroku is a platform for instant deployment of Ruby/Rails web apps.__

Heroku is a completely novel approach to deploying web applications.  Forget
about servers; the fundamental unit is the app.  Use the [Heroku client
gem](/heroku-command) to create and manage apps from the command line. Then
[deploy your code with Git](/git), and control the running app with [the remote
Ruby console](/console) and [rake commands](/rake).

All users should start with the [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart).

Then after you've deployed your first app, check out these goodies:

  * [Managing gems](/gems)
  * [Using your own custom domain name](/custom-domains)
  * [Deploying a Rake, Sinatra, or Merb app](/rack)
  * [Importing an existing database](/taps)
