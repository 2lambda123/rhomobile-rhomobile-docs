Heroku Documentation
====================

Heroku is a platform for the instant deployment of Ruby applications.  The
common workflow is:

 1. Use the command-line tool to create a new app.
 2. Git push a copy of your code, run any database migrations.
 3. Visit the app's web URL (e.g., `http://myapp.heroku.com`) to see it running
    instantly.
 4. Do more local development, then go to #2.

If you're familiar with hosting Rails apps in traditional hosting environments,
you may be surprised to learn that you have no ssh access, no single unix user,
and in fact not even a single server associated with your app.  Your app is
distributed across our cluster in an intelligent manner according to its load in
a way that is completely invisible to you.  In short, forget about servers:
think about apps instead.

Managing apps is extremely fluid, not unlike managing files on your local
filesystem.  You can create, rename, change settings, and destroy apps
instantaneously.  Interaction with the app is done through Git (for code),
remote console and rake commands (for managing the database), and other API
commands executed through the command-line tool.
