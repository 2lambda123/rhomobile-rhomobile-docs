Maintenance Mode
================

If you're deploying a large migration or need to disable access to your application for some length of time, you can use Heroku's built in maintenance mode. Enable it like so:

    $ heroku maintenance:on

Once your application is ready, you can disable maintenance mode with:

    $ heroku maintenance:off
