Memcache
========

Memcache is an in-memory transient key/value store typically used for caching.  It's a key technology for building scalable web apps.

Gem setup
---------

The [memcache-auth](http://github.com/pedro/memcache-auth) gem is the only Ruby memcache client that will work on Heroku.  So first remove any memcache client gems you may already be using from your application, such as memcache-client or memcached.  Then add memcache-auth to your Gemfile:

    {ruby}
    gem 'memcache-auth'

Run `gem bundle` to fetch and build the memcache-auth gem within your app.

Using from Rails
----------------

Rails abstracts the caching mechanisms through Rails.cache.  

For Rails version 2.3.3 and higher, add the gem to config/environment.rb:

    {ruby}
    config.gem 'memcache-auth'
    
Configure your app to use memcache for the cache store in production.  Add the following to config/environment/production.rb:

    {ruby}
    config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, MemcacheAuth::Rails.new
    
In your development environment, Rails.cache will default to an in-memory memory store that doesn't require a running memcached.

You can test writing to the local memory cache in a console:

    $ script/console
    >> Rails.cache.write('color', 'red')

And fetching the data back:

    >> Rails.cache.read('color')
    => "red"

Using from Sinatra
----------------

### Local memcached

You'll need to run a local memcached process to test against with Sinatra or other Ruby app.  Install it on Mac OS X:

    $ sudo port install memcached

Or on Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install memcached

You can also download the source from [the memcached site](http://memcached.org/).

Now run the memcached daemon:

    $ memcached -vv
    slab class   1: chunk size     88 perslab 11915
    ...
    <15 server listening

### Sinatra app

In your configure block:

    {ruby}
    configure do
      require 'memcache-auth'
      CACHE = MemcacheAuth.new
    end

Test it out in a console:

    $ irb -r myapp.rb
    >> CACHE['color'] = 'blue'

You should see output like this in your memcached -vv terminal:

    <18 set color 0 604800 7
    >18 STORED

Now read it back:

    >> CACHE['color']
    => "blue"

Deploying to Heroku
------------------

To use memcache on Heroku, install the memcache add-on:

    $ heroku addons:add memcache

If you're using the memcache-auth gem as described above, your app will use memcache on Heroku without any further code changes.
