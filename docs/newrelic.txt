New Relic
=========

New Relic RPM is an on-demand performance management solution for web applications developed in Ruby. The New Relic RPM Plugin offers seamless integration with the Heroku platform enabling immediate and automatic access to RPMâ€™s comprehensive capabilities for monitoring, troubleshooting and tuning web applications.

Supported Frameworks
--------------------

RPM is only available for Ruby on Rails apps at this time.

Add-on Installation
-------------------

To install the add-on, run

    $ heroku addons:add newrelic:bronze
    
Upgrading from an existing New Relic Install
--------------------------------------------

If you already have New Relic installed, simply install the add-on as above, and you're done.

Adding the add-on will automatically point you to the integrated Heroku/New Relic account.  This means you will only see data from after you installed the add-on.

You're welcome to keep or remove the plugin and configuration from your code repository.  If you remove it, we will automatically keep you up-to-date with the latest version.

What the Add-on does
--------------------

The RPM addon will automatically creates a private account on RPM, and configures access for Heroku's servers.  The add-on will then install the latest New Relic plugin if you don't already have it installed.  This is the same as you running the command:

    $ script/plugin install http://newrelic.rubyforge.org/svn/newrelic_rpm

We then autoconfigure your newrelic.yml file with the proper access keys.
