Heroku Quickstart Guide
=======================

Install the Heroku gem:

    $ sudo gem install heroku-0.5.2.gem
    Successfully installed heroku-0.5.2
    1 gem installed

Start with an existing Rails app, or create a fresh app on your local system via
the "rails" command.  Then cd into the app's checkout dir.

If you aren't already using Git to track the app's revisions, run these
commands:

    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "new app"
    Created initial commit 5df2d09: new app
     44 files changed, 8393 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Now you're ready to create a new app on Heroku:

    $ heroku create
    Enter your Heroku credentials.
    Email: joe@example.com
    Password: 
    Uploading ssh public key /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

You'll be prompted for your username and password the first time you run a
heroku command; they'll be saved on `~/.heroku/credentials` so that you aren't
prompted on future runs.  It will also upload your public key to allow you to
push and pull code.

The final line of output from the create command will be something like this:

    Created http://vivid-mountain-91.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:vivid-mountain-91.git

The app has been created and two URLs are provided: one for the web face of your
new app, and one for the Git repository that you will push your code to.  Cut
and paste the second url to add a Git remote and push to it:

    $ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:vivid-mountain-91.git
    $ git push heroku master
    updating 'refs/heads/master'
    from 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
    to   2e1fc57ac1b427d213ede5733aa114d31ab6424f
    Also local refs/remotes/heroku/master

Your code has been pushed to Heroku.  At this point you may need to run
migrations (`db:migrate`), load the `schema.rb` (`db:schema:load`), or whatever
method your app uses to bootstrap its database.  For example:

    $ heroku rake db:migrate
    (in /mnt/home/slugs/41913_b81cc1e5813c58c443e4120aff984d006f36ef20/mnt)
    == 20081118092504 CreateWidgets: migrating ====================================
    -- create_table(:widgets)
       -> 0.0519s
    == 20081118092504 CreateWidgets: migrated (0.0520s) ===========================

Finally, visit the web URL provided by the create command.  After a brief delay
for the app server to launch, your app's front page will appear.

NOTE: Heroku supports Rails 2.0.2, Rails 2.1.0, and Rails 2.2.2.

From this point, you can work on your app locally, committing changes via Git.
When you're ready to deploy your changes:

    $ git push heroku

Congratulations, you've got your app running on Heroku.
