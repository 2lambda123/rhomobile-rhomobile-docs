Heroku Quickstart Guide
=======================

Install the Heroku gem:

    $ sudo gem install heroku
    Successfully installed heroku-0.6
    1 gem installed

Start with an existing Rails app, or create a fresh app on your local system via
the "rails" command.  Then cd into the app's checkout dir.

If you aren't already using Git to track the app's revisions, run these
commands:

    $ git init
    Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "new app"
    Created initial commit 5df2d09: new app
     44 files changed, 8393 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

Now you're ready to create a new app on Heroku:

    $ heroku create
    Enter your Heroku credentials.
    Email: joe@example.com
    Password: 
    Uploading ssh public key /Users/joe/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

You'll be prompted for your username and password the first time you run a
heroku command; they'll be saved on `~/.heroku/credentials` so that you aren't
prompted on future runs.  It will also upload your public key to allow you to
push and pull code.

The final line of output from the create command will be something like this:

    Created http://vivid-mountain-91.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:vivid-mountain-91.git
    Git remote heroku added

The app has been created and two URLs are provided: one for the web face of your new app, and one for the Git repository that you will push your code to.  A Git remote named heroku is added for you automatically, so all that remains is to push up your code to Heroku:

    $ git push heroku master
    Counting objects: 65, done.
    Compressing objects: 100% (58/58), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (65/65), 80.54 KiB, done.
    Total 65 (delta 14), reused 0 (delta 0)

    -----> Heroku receiving push
    -----> Rails app detected
           Compiled slug size is 0.1MB
    -----> Launching....... done
           App deployed to Heroku

    To git@heroku.com:vivid-mountain-91.git
     * [new branch]      master -> master

Your app is now deployed to Heroku.

At this point you may need to run migrations (db:migrate), load the schema.rb (db:schema:load), or whatever other method your app uses to bootstrap its database.  For example:

    $ heroku rake db:migrate
    (in /mnt/home/slugs/41913_b81cc1e5813c58c443e4120aff984d006f36ef20/mnt)
    == 20081118092504 CreateWidgets: migrating ====================================
    -- create_table(:widgets)
       -> 0.0519s
    == 20081118092504 CreateWidgets: migrated (0.0520s) ===========================

Finally, run this command to open the app in your browser:

    $ heroku open

From here forward you can continue to develop your app locally.  When you have changes to deploy, make sure everything is committed, and then use a push to deploy the updates:

    $ git push heroku
