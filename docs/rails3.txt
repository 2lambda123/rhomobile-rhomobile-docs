Rails 3
=======

Rails 3.0.X works on Heroku with Ruby 1.8.7 on the [bamboo](/bamboo) [stack](/stack).  Due to a [bug](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) in Ruby 1.9.1 you can only run Rails 3 apps in 1.8.7.
We have a Ruby 1.9.2 stack in beta, see our [stacks](/stack) page for more details.

Serving Static Assets
---------------------

Rails 3 defaults will not serve static assets in production, such as your javascript, HTML files, images, etc.  Heroku requires that this be enabled to work correctly.  During deploy, we auto-detect if this is set to false, and install [a plugin](http://github.com/pedro/rails3_serve_static_assets) that simply flips this to true.  You can also manually set this to true by editing config/environments/production.rb and setting this line:

    config.serve_static_assets = true
