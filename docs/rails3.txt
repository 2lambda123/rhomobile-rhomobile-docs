Rails 3 (Beta)
=======

Heroku allows you to run Rails 3 on the [bamboo](/bamboo) [stack](/stack) with Ruby 1.8.7.  **This is currently experimental, as Rails 3 and associated components are evolving quickly, sometimes breaking compatibility.**  We currently support Rails [3.0.0.rc](http://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions/3.0.0.rc).

Serving Static Assets
---------------------

Rails 3 defaults will not serve static assets in production, such as your javascript, HTML files, images, etc.  Heroku requires that this be enabled to work correctly.  During deploy, we auto-detect if this is set to false, and install [a plugin](http://github.com/pedro/rails3_serve_static_assets) that simply flips this to true.  You can also manually set this to true by editing config/environments/production.rb and setting this line:

    config.serve_static_assets = true
    
Configuring your database
-------------------------

Heroku will automatically rewrite your database.yml file with the correct settings.  Heroku uses a postgres database.  To connect to the database, you'll need to include the "pg" gem in your gemfile.  

Gem Bundler
-----------
