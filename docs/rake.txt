Running rake commands
=====================

Run rake commands on the remote app:

    $ heroku rake db:version
    (in /mnt/home/slugs/41913_b81cc1e5813c58c443e4120aff984d006f36ef20/mnt)
    Current version: 20081118092504

You can pass arguments like `--trace` or `VERSION=` after the rake command, just as you would locally.

NOTE: Rake commands which write to the filesystem, like <code>rake db:schema:dump</code>, will not work because of Heroku's read-only filesystem.
