Renaming apps
=============

You can rename an app at any time with this command:

    $ heroku rename newname
    http://newname.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:newname.git
    Don't forget to update your Git remotes on any local checkouts.

Renaming an app will cause it to become unavailable on the old subdomain (oldname.heroku.com) and available on the new name (newname.heroku.com) immediately.  This may not matter if you're using a custom domain name, but be aware that any external links will need to be updated.

Updating the Git remote
-----------------------

You will need to update any git remotes that you have defined in your checkouts after a rename:

    $ git remote rm heroku
    $ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:newname.git

Replace "newname" with the new name of your app, especified in the rename command.

NOTE: If your app has collaborators, inform them of the change so that they may run these commands as well.

NOTE: You can see all remotes and the git URLs they reference by typing "git remote -v".  You can also see and edit the full details for all remotes in your current git repo by editing the file .git/config.
