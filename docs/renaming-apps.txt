Renaming apps
=============

You can rename an app at any time with this command:

    $ heroku rename newname
    http://newname.heroku.com/ | git@heroku.com:newname.git
    Git remote heroku updated

Renaming an app will cause it to immediately become available on the new subdomain (newname.heroku.com) and unavailable on the old name (oldname.heroku.com).  This may not matter if you're using a custom domain name, but be aware that any external links will need to be updated.

Updating the Git remote
-----------------------

If you are inside the Git checkout directory, your remote will be updated automatically.  But other checkouts, such as those belonging to other developers, will need to be updated manually:

    $ git remote rm heroku
    $ git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:newname.git

Replace "newname" with the new name of the app, especified in the rename command.

NOTE: You can see all remotes and the git URLs they reference by typing "git remote -v".  You can also see and edit the full details for all remotes in your current git repo by editing the file .git/config.
