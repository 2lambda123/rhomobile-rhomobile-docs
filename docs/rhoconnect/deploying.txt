Deploying a RhoConnect Application
===

Since RhoConnect applications are standard ruby [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) applications, you have many hosting options.  This section will cover two ways to deploy a RhoConnect application: use the RhoHub service, deploy to an on-premise server.

## Preparing App for Production
By default your RhoConnect application generates a few files that you should be familiar with and understand the settings.

### `config.ru`
This rackup file contains runtime configuration for the RhoConnect sinatra application:
	
	:::ruby
	Rhoconnect::Server.disable :run
	Rhoconnect::Server.disable :clean_trace
	Rhoconnect::Server.enable  :raise_errors
	Rhoconnect::Server.set     :secret,      '<changeme>'
	Rhoconnect::Server.set     :root,        ROOT_PATH
	Rhoconnect::Server.use     Rack::Static, :urls => ["/data"], :root => Rhoconnect::Server.root
	
The important setting here `:secret` you will want to change.  `:secret` should be set to a long random string, it ___should not___ be set to a dictionary word or short string (30 characters or more is sufficient).  This is used for the session storage using a digest algorithm as described [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#session-storage).

If you don't change the `:secret` setting, RhoConnect automatically warns you each time the application starts:

 	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12] ************************************************************

	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12] WARNING: Change the session secret in config.ru from <changeme> to something secure.
	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12]   i.e. running `rake rhoconnect:secret` in your app will generate a secret you could use.

	[11:34:56 AM 2011-01-12] ************************************************************
	

As this warning states, a good way to generate a cryptographically secure secret is by running `rake rhoconnect:secret` in your RhoConnect  application.

	:::term
	$ cd storemanager-server
	$ rake rhoconnect:secret
	040a2355475e9d0fb591ef78d5b9ca61a34cbcfd3f11942b18bc1d91f1ca66c27b2e0386333843a7efa29f40fff03624cd908d0883364ffbfa3208ab23fa2664
	
Then plug this secret into your `config.ru`:

	:::ruby
	Rhoconnect::Server.set     :secret, '040a2355475e9d0fb591ef78d5b9ca61a34cbcfd3f11942b18bc1d91f1ca66c27b2e0386333843a7efa29f40fff03624cd908d0883364ffbfa3208ab23fa2664'

To run RhoConnect in production mode, use `RACK_ENV` environment variable set to "production".  This ensures RhoConnect will use the `:production` section of the settings.  For example:

	:::term
	$ thin start -e production -p 9292

Will start thin in with `RACK_ENV` set to "production".  

NOTE: If you deploy using passenger or on RhoHub, this variable is automatically set to production.

### `settings/settings.yml`
This file contains all source adapter options and settings like the redis server connection.  Before deploying to production, make sure you have the appropriate production settings:

	:::yaml
	:sources: 
	  Product: 
	    :poll_interval: 300

	:production: 
	  :redis: myredishost:6379
	  :licensefile: settings/license.key
	  :syncserver: http://localhost:9292/application/

### `settings/license.key`
This contains your RhoConnect license key text.  By default, a RhoConnect application comes with a 10 device license.  Please see the [licensing page](/rhoconnect/licensing) for more details.

## Hosting on RhoHub
The [RhoHub](/rhohub/introduction) service offers several [production RhoConnect application hosting levels](http://rhohub.com/pricing).  Simply sign up on [rhohub.com](http://rhohub.com/) and go through the [tutorial](/rhohub/tutorial) on deploying your first RhoConnect application with RhoHub.

## Deploying On-Premise
The [sinatra book](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com/) has some great [deployment documentation](http://sinatra-book.gittr.com/#deployment) that you should review before running your RhoConnect application in production.

## Deploying into J2EE environment
In JRuby environment, there is an option to create the WAR container for the Rhoconnect app
and deploy it into the J2EE App Server.
(see the corresponding 'rake' task for creating the WAR containers).
Deploying the WAR container varies per J2EE App Server, for JBoss it is necessary
to place the WAR file into the server's deploy directory.

We recommend using the [phusion passenger](http://modrails.com/index.html) stack for deploying an on-premise RhoConnect application.  Please refer to the [section on rack applications](http://modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#_deploying_a_rack_based_ruby_application) for information on deploying a RhoConnect sinatra application.

## Deploying packaged RhoConnect software on Linux servers

You can create RhoConnect production environment on Linux servers by installing software packages
for Ubuntu and Cent OS respectively. At this moment supported formats are Debian (deb) and Red Hat (rpm) packages.

Every package provides the following components:

* Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby Enterprise Edition 2011.03
 
* Nginx HTTP server

* Phusion Passenger

* Redis data store

* Rhoconnect gem with all required dependencies 
 
In addition, RPM package provides latest Sqlite3 headers and binaries, because standard Cent OS (5.x) libraries for Sqlite3 outdated.

### Getting the Packages

To download the rhoconnect debian package, you first must add our repo to your list of sources.

#### Steps for Debian-Based Linux Users
	:::term
	$ sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://rhoconnect.s3.amazonaws.com/packages/deb rhoconnect main"

Once the repo is added apt-get needs to be updated
	:::term
	$ sudo apt-get update

Once that is done, it is time to install rhoconnect
	:::term
	$ sudo apt-get install rhoconnect

#### Steps for Red-Hat-Based Linux Users
To do this, you must create a file named <b>rhoconnect.repo</b>in the <b>/etc/yum.repos.d/</b>.
	:::term
	$ sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/rhoconnect.repo

Copy and paste these contents into the file.
<pre>
[rhoconnect]
name=Rhoconnect
baseurl=http://rhoconnect.s3.amazonaws.com/packages/rpm
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
</pre>

Once that is done, it is time to install rhoconnect
	:::term
	$ sudo yum install rhoconnect

### Final Steps (After the installer is finished)
Installer also created and configured RhoConnect <b>rhoapp</b> application in <b>/opt/nginx/html</b> directory.
To test it you need to as a root user start redis and nginx servers:
<pre>
/etc/init.d/redis start
/etc/init.d/nginx start
</pre>

And verify that it's up and running by visiting application web console in your browser:
<pre>
http://server_ip_address/console/
</pre>
