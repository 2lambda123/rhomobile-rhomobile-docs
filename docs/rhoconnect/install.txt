Installing RhoConnect
===

## Windows

If you're running Windows, download the latest [RhoConnect windows installer](http://github.com/rhomobile/rhoconnect/downloads).  This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), and a default RhoConnect application so you don't need to generate one by hand.

Your RhoConnect application folder will be located in C:\RhoConnect\rhoconnect by default so you can skip to the [generating a source instructions](/rhoconnect/command-line#rhoconnect-generator) in the next section.

## Mac OS / Linux

### Prerequisites

1. [Ruby v1.8.7+](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)

2. [RubyGems v1.8.5+](http://rubygems.org/pages/download) 

3. Ruby Web Server - We test with [thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), and [passenger](http://www.modrails.com/).  WEBrick, the web server that ships with ruby, is known to cause issues with HTTP headers/cookies and is ***not*** recommended.

4. [Redis 2.2.13+](http://redis.io/) - RhoConnect includes a simple [rake task](/rhoconnect/command-line#rake-tasks) `redis:install` to install redis, covered in the next section.  Alternatively, you can [install redis directly](http://redis.io/download).

### Installing RhoConnect Gem

To install the RhoConnect gem, run:

	:::term
  	$ [sudo] gem install rhoconnect --pre
