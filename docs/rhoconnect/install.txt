# Installing RhoConnect

This section discusses how to install the development environment for RhoConnect. For those who have developed a RhoConnect application, and now wish to deploy that RhoConnect application on a server, refer to the instructions for deploying a RhoConnect application, such as [preparing a RhoConnect app for production](/rhoconnect/preparing-production) and [deploying a RhoConnect application](/rhoconnect/deploying).

On Windows and Mac OS, the usual way to install the RhoConnect development environment is to install RhoStudio. 

On Linux, you install the RhoConnect gem from the command line; you can also do this from Windows or Mac OS.

## Mac OS

If you're running Mac OS, download the latest [Motorola RhoMobile Suite Installer for Macintosh](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-mac). This contains [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

Mac OS has [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed. It is recommended that you install [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io//) and install Ruby version 1.9.3, latest patch.

Click on the RhoStudioInstaller for Mac download file to open it. You will get a window similar to this:

<img src="http://rhodocs.s3.amazonaws.com/rhodes-devel/rhostudio-mac-install.png" alt="RhoStudioInstaller Mac" />

Run the install gems script appropriate for you. If you have Ruby Version Manager, you can run "Install gems on rvm." A terminal window will open; wait for the gems install process to complete.

Then drag RhoStudio to the Applications folder. 

## Windows

If you're running Windows, download the latest [Motorola RhoMobile Suite Installer for Windows](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-windows) and run it. This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction), and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

If you are running Windows 64-bit, you need to use 32-bit Java when you run RhoStudio. You can include the 32-bit Java in the PATH, or you can run RhoStudio with a link to 32-bit Java:

	C:\RhoStudio\eclipse\RhoStudio.exe -vm "<32-bit java path>\bin\javaw.exe"

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for RhoStudio. If you are planning to build for Blackberry or Android, make sure you have JDK version 1.6.0_2 or higher installed; the 32-bit Windows version of the JDK is required for Blackberry tools.

### Installing the Java Development Kit

The Sun JDK for Windows or Linux is available [here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). For Windows, install the 32-bit version of the JDK; RhoStudio needs the 32-bit version.

For Mac OS 10.6 and earlier, the JDK is already installed. For Mac OS 10.7, Java is not automatically installed. Download the Java for Mac Installer from [Apple support](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421) and install Java.

### Setting the JDK Path

On Windows installs for RhoMobile, go to RhoStudio Preferences (Windows -> Preferences) and set the JDK path in the rhobuild.yml file. On Windows 64-bit installations, you must set this path to the 32-bit version of the JDK, such as `C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.7.0_01/bin`.

On Mac OS, the path to the JDK is automatically set once Java is installed.

For Linux and for RhoConnect installs from the command line, set the JDK path in JAVA_HOME and PATH.

## Installing RhoConnect from the Command Line

To install RhoConnect on Linux, and to install RhoConnect on Windows or Mac OS using the command line (this does not install RhoStudio), you need to install the Rhodes gem. Download and install:

1. [Ruby v1.9.3](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (On Windows, [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org) is a convenient way to install Ruby; you should check "Add Ruby executables to your PATH" and "Associate .rb and .rbw files with this Ruby installation".)

2. Ruby Web Server - We tested with [thin](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin/), and [passenger](http://www.modrails.com/). WEBrick, the web server that ships with ruby, is known to cause issues with HTTP headers/cookies and is ***not*** recommended.

3. [Redis](http://redis.io/) - RhoConnect includes a simple [rake task](/rhoconnect/command-line#rake-tasks) `redis:install` to install redis, covered in the [Rake Tasks section](rhoconnect/command-line#rake-tasks). Alternatively, you can [install redis directly](http://redis.io/download).

4. Install the RhoConnect Gem. Run this command to install.

	:::term
	$ [sudo] gem install rhoconnect

NOTE: If you get any `no such file to load -- something` messages while running the rake tasks or rhodes commands, this can usually be resolved by putting "sudo" in front of the command, as in `sudo gem install something`.

NOTE: Windows doesn't come with the necessary build tools to install gems ('make', for example). There are various ways to get these tools, but the GnuWin32 project at http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/ provides the tools, and can be conveniently installed via the GetGnuWin32 installer at http://sourceforge.net/projects/getgnuwin32/files/. You should follow the GetGnuWin32 instructions carefully.

You can [install RhoStudio as a plugin for Eclipse](rhostudio-eclipse).

RhoSimulator, which comes with RhoStudio for Mac and Windows, does not work with Linux.

## Setting the Location of the RhoStudio Workspace Directory

When you start RhoStudio, you can set the location of the workspace directory. The path to the workspace directory should not contain space symbols: if the path has spaces, a RhoConnect application created with RhoStudio will not work properly.
