RhoConnect settings
===

All Rhoconnect application and source settings located in the *`settings/settings.yml`* file.
There are two main categories: application environment settings and source settings.

## Application settings

Application-wide settings are specified per deployment environment (`:test`, `:development`, `:production`).
Each of the environment categories must have the following entries:
	
	:::yaml
	:syncserver: <url> - application's base url
	:redis: <url> - Redis url
	:licensefile: <filename> - application's license file
	
In addition, the following settings can be specified:

	:::yaml
	:poll_interval_default: <secs> - default sync poll interval setting for source adapters.
									 This setting is used as a default if source doesn't specify
									 its own value. Also, it is applied to dynamic adapters
									 as a default sync poll interval.
	:bulk_data_poll_interval: <secs> - poll interval setting for bulk data sync
	
## Source settings

All source-specific settings are specified under the corresponding source name entry in the `:sources` category.
Typical source settings include:

	:::yaml
	:poll_interval: <secs> - source's sync poll interval.
	:force_default: <true|false> - if specified, this setting forces to use 
									 default application poll interval
								     even if source has its own setting.
    :partition_type: <app|user> - default partition type for the source
