# Using RhoSimulator

RhoSimulator allows to [run](#run-application-in-rhosimulator) Rhodes applications without lengthy build process and to [debug](#debugging-with-rhostudio) them in [RhoStudio](../rhostudio.tutorial). Currently RhoSimulator works on <b>Windows</b> only.

## Install RhoSimulator

If you have [Rhodes gem](/install#installing-rhodes-from-the-command-line), then RhoSimulator is installed already.

If you would like to run RhoSimulator without Rhodes gem, download [Windows](http://rhosimulator.s3.amazonaws.com/RhoSimulator.zip) or
[Mac OS X](http://rhosimulator.s3.amazonaws.com/RhoSimulator.tbz2) version, extract it and specify path to `rhosimulator.exe` or `RhoSimulator.app` respectively at `rhodes/rhobuild.yml`:

        env: 
           paths:    
              rhosimulator: <RhoSimulator folder>

Alternatively you may [build](#build-rhosimulator) your own customized version of RhoSimulator as described [below](#build-rhosimulator).

## Run application in RhoSimulator

To run application in RhoSimulator just run in rhodes or application folder:

    #run RhoSimulator to simulate specific platform:
    rake run:android:rhosimulator 
    rake run:iphone:rhosimulator
    
    #bbver from build.yml will be used as System.get_property('os_version')
    rake run:bb:rhosimulator
    
    rake run:wm:rhosimulator
    rake run:wp:rhosimulator

    #run RhoSimulator to simulate 'UNKNOWN' platform:
    rake run:win32:rhosimulator

If you modified Rhodes application sources, just press 'Refresh' in RhoSimulator to reload application, i.e. generally no RhoSimulator restart is required.
The restart of RhoSimulator is required only if a model was added/modified or some code was added to the AppApplication class.

## Debugging with RhoStudio

### Prerequisites

* Install [RhoStudio](../rhostudio.tutorial)
* Install [RhoSimulator](#install-rhosimulator)
* Ensure your application is configured properly and successfully [runs in RhoSimulator](#run-application-in-rhosimulator) (from command line as described above)

### Starting debug session in RhoStudio

* Select Run » Debug Configurations... from top menu
* Find 'Rhodes Application' section on the left and add new (or modify existing) configuration
* On 'Common setting' tab select a project by clicking 'Browse...' button next to 'Project name:'
* Select 'Rho simulator' as the platform
* Click 'Apply' and then 'Debug'

### Debug capabilities

In present version of RhoStudio you may:

* Set breakpoints in Ruby code (.rb files)
* Watch variable values (global, local, class and instance) - currently auto-watch list is displayed in Expressions window
* View application log in Console window

## Build RhoSimulator

If you use custom native extensions, then running and debugging your applications in RhoSimulator requires a custom build.
Follow these instructions to build your own customized version of RhoSimulator.

### Preliminary steps for Windows

* Currently only <b>Visual Studio 2008</b> is supported
* Follow [Build for Windows - Prerequisites](build#build-for-windows)

### Preliminary steps for Mac OS X

* Follow [Building a Rhodes Application for iPhone/iPad - Prerequisites](build#building-a-rhodes-application-for-iphoneipad), but do not install the Rhodes gem since you're going to use Rhodes SDK source.
* Get the `rhodes` source (if haven't done it already) as described [here](build#setup-rhodes-source-code). Don't forget to add the `bin` folder to your path, run `rhodes-setup` and update Rhodes SDK path in `build.yml` at your application root folder.
* First build the Qt libraries for Mac from sources to enable HTTPS protocol support in RhoSimulator:
    * Download the Qt source:
        * Go to [http://qt.nokia.com/downloads](http://qt.nokia.com/downloads)
        * Jump to `Qt libraries`
        * Download the [source code as a gzipped tar](http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.1.tar.gz) (229 MB)
        * Extract the downloaded archive, e.g. into `~/qt-4.8.1`
    * Make sure that your `PATH` environment variable does not contain the path to any previously installed Qt binaries
    * Add to your `~/.profile` the new environment variable `QTDIR` by adding the line (or by changing the existing `QTDIR` variable):

			export QTDIR=/Developer/SDKs/Qt

    * Open `Terminal.app` and issue commands:

			$ cd ~/qt-4.8.1
			$ ./configure -opensource -platform macx-g++
			  -nomake examples -nomake demos -nomake docs
			  -qt-libpng -qt-libjpeg -qt-libtiff -qt-libmng
			  -webkit -prefix /Developer/SDKs/Qt -release
			$ make
			$ sudo make install

      Be aware that it will take a while to build the Qt libraries from sources (maybe few hours or so).

### Enable bundled native extensions

To enable `digest` native extensions bundled with Rhodes SDK make sure that the default application in your `rhobuild.yml` is the `framework_spec`:

	app: [...]/rhodes/spec/framework_spec

To compile RhoSimulator with the custom native extensions change this path to your own Rhodes application home folder.
It should be noted that extensions you'd like to compile into RhoSimulator should be listed in the main `extensions`
section of your Rhodes application `build.yml` (but not in its platform-specific `extensions` sections).

### Build RhoSimulator with rake command:

When you've finished all the preliminary steps for your OS, the only thing you need to do is to run the rake command in the `rhodes` source folder:

	rake build:rhosimulator

To run Rhodes applications in the custom built RhoSimulator, please ensure that no `env:` » `paths:` » `rhosimulator:` line is present at your `rhobuild.yml` (if present, remove that line).

### Build RhoSimulator for Windows in Visual Studio 2008:

* Open the solution:
  `<path-to-ruby>\lib\ruby\gems\<version-number>\gems\rhodes-<version-number>\platform\wm\rhodes.sln`
* Build solution for the configuration `SimulatorRelease|Win32`
* Specify the path to custom built RhoSimulator at `rhobuild.yml`:
        env:
          paths:
            rhosimulator: platform/wm/bin/Win32/rhodes/SimulatorRelease
