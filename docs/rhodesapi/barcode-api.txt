# Barcode API

Allows the device to recognize a barcode. See the controller and view in the /app/BarcodeRecognizer folder of the [System API Samples application](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/blob/master/app/BarcodeRecognizer/controller.rb) for an example.

**NOTE: As of Rhodes version 3.3.3, the [Barcode](/rhodesapi/barcode-api), is removed from Rhodes. This feature is only supported in Motorola RhoMobile Suite. If you wish to use this feature, you will need to [upgrade to RhoMobile Suite](/rhomobile-install). Your application's build.yml will also need to be modified to [indicate the application type is 'Rhoelements'](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-native#enabling-motorola-device-capabilities). Additionally, a [RhoElements license](/rhoelements/licensing) is required.**

## Using JavaScript API

You can call some of the Barcode methods from JavaScript as well as Ruby. To use the Javascript API, add the `public/js/rho_javascript_api.js` file to the .html, .erb, or .js file calling the JavaScript method.

The JavaScript API methods with a return value can pass it as a parameter in jQuery-compatible continuation (deferred object, a kind of callback). Possible continuations to handle are done, fail, and complete.

	Rho.Class.method(params).done(function(handler) { /* handler... */ })

You must enable JavaScript by putting `rho-javascript` into extensions in your build.yml.

	:::yaml
	extensions: ["rho-javascript"]

You must have a [RhoElements license](/rhoelements/licensing) to use the JavaScript API.

## Enabling Barcode Recognition

You need to enable the camera on the device. Do this by adding that capability to the build.yml file:

	:::yaml
	capabilities:
	  - camera

On iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, and Blackberry (`iphone`, `android`, `wm`, `bb`), you need to add the barcode extension:

	:::yaml
	:iphone
	  extensions: ["barcode"]

## barcode_recognize

Recognizes a barcode on an image. Returns a string with recognized code, or empty string if the barcode is not recognized.

Ruby Syntax:

	:::ruby
	Barcode.barcode_recognize(image_file_full_path)

JavaScript syntax:

	:::html
	Rho.Barcode.barcode_recognize(image_file_full_path)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>image_file_full_path</code></td>
	<td>String. Path to the image that contains the barcode to be recognized.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## take_barcode

iPhone and Android only. Open a user interface for real-time barcode recognition from the device camera. If a barcode is found, the user can confirm barcode recognition, or continue to try to recognize the barcode. When the user confirms or cancels, the callback is called.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Barcode.take_barcode(url_for :action => :take_callback)

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho.Barcode.take_barcode(callback_function)
	Rho.Barcode.take_barcode(callback_function, params)

An example of params (camera or deviceName) can be `camera: "front"`.

Android only. You can also use the front camera for take_barcode.

	:::ruby
	Barcode.take_barcode(url_for(:action => :take_callback), {:camera => 'front'})

You can optionally specify a specific device scanner (ex: the device may have a 1D laser scanner and a camera - both are capable of scanning barcodes), otherwise the first available scanner object will be used.

    :::ruby
    Barcode.take_barcode(url_for(:action => :barcode_callback), {:deviceName=>deviceName_from_enumerate})

The callback receives these parameters:

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>status</code></td>
	<td>OK or CANCEL</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>barcode</code></td>
	<td>The string for the recognized barcode.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## enumerate

Get a list of scanners present on the device. Returns an array of hashes ('name','id').

	:::ruby
    Barcode.enumerate(url_for(:action => :enumerate_callback))

Callback parameters:

* scannerArray - array of Hashes("deviceName","friendlyName")

## enable
 
Enables the scanner. `barcode_callback` gets the same parameters as `Barcode.take_barcode`.

    :::ruby
    Barcode.enable(url_for(:action => :barcode_callback), {:deviceName=>deviceName_from_enumerate})

Callback parameters:

* "status" - "ok" or "cancel".
* "barcode" - the recognized barcode string.

## disable

Disables the currently enabled scanner. This reverts the scanner to its default state and flushes any current decoder settings.

    :::ruby    
    Barcode.disable

## start

Performs a soft trigger start. If the scan does not result in a decode it is necessary to perform a soft stop before another soft start .  

    :::ruby    
    Barcode.start

### stop

Performs a soft trigger stop.

    :::ruby    
    Barcode.stop
