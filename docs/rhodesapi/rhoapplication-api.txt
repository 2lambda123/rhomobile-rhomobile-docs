Access methods for Rhodes applications. Refer to [File System access in Device Capabilities](/rhodes/device-caps#file-system-access) for an example using file access.

## get_base_app_path

Returns a string that contains the absolute path to the application.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Rho::RhoApplication.get_base_app_path()

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho.RhoApplication.get_base_app_path()

## get_app_path

Returns a string that contains the absolute path path to the given relative path in the application.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Rho::RhoApplication.get_app_path(relativePath)

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho.RhoApplication.get_app_path(relativePath)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>relativePath</code></td>
	<td>String. The relative path in the application.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## get_model_path

Returns a string that contains the absolute path to a model folder in the application.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Rho::RhoApplication.get_model_path('app', model)

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho::RhoApplication.get_model_path('app', model)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>'app'</code></td>
	<td>Always set the first parameter in get_model_path to 'app'.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>model</code></td>
	<td>String. The model name.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## get_blob_path

Returns the real path to a blob (such as a digital photo). You need to use this method to have the correct path to a blob attribute.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Rho::RhoApplication.get_blob_path(relativeFilePath)

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho.RhoApplication.get_blob_path(relativeFilePath)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>relativeFilePath</code></td>
	<td>String. The path to the blob file.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## get_blob_folder

Returns the absolute path to the folder where blobs, such as digital photos, are created in this application.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Rho::RhoApplication.get_blob_folder()

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho.RhoApplication.get_blob_folder()

## get_user_path

Returns the path to the user folder. iOS only.

On the iOS platform, only the files stored in the Documents folder are backed up in iCloud. Before Rhodes 3.3.2, all files were stored in the Documents folder. Apple requires that the Documents folder only contains files that the user created and works with directly: other files should not be created there.

From Rhodes 3.3.2 and on, all files except databases are stored in /Library/Caches/Private Documents/. Files in this folder are not backed up to iCloud. To make those files back up, you can put the files into the user folder. Get that path with get_user_path. All your files created in Rhodes versions before 3.3.2 in Rho::RhoApplication.get_base_app_path, now should be created in Rho::RhoApplication.get_user_path.

Ruby syntax:

	:::ruby
	Rho::RhoApplication.get_user_path()

JavaScript syntax:

	Rho.RhoApplication.get_user_path()
