# SignatureCapture API

Allows the device to take a signature and save it as an image. See the controller and view in the /app/SignatureUtil folder of the [System API Samples application](https://github.com/rhomobile/rhodes-system-api-samples/blob/master/app/SignatureUtil/controller.rb) for an example.

## take

Opens a window on the device where user draws his signature. Saves the  signature as an image.

	:::ruby
	Rho::SignatureCapture.take(callback_url, params)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>callback_url</code></td>
	<td>url to callback method called after the user enters a signature.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>params</code></td>
	<td>A hash containing the parameters.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Inline Signature APIs

Windows Mobile and Windows CE devices support signature capture started in window, which you can show over current page(scrolling is not supported in this case). The Inline Signature API consists of the methods visible, capture, and clear.

**NOTE: As of Rhodes version 3.3.3, the Inline Signature API is removed from Rhodes. This feature is only supported in Motorola RhoMobile Suite. If you wish to use this feature, you will need to [upgrade to RhoMobile Suite](/rhomobile-install). Your application's build.yml will also need to be modified to [indicate the application type is 'Rhoelements'](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-native#enabling-motorola-device-capabilities). Additionally, a [RhoElements license](/rhoelements/licensing) is required.**

## visible

Display window hand writing, where user draw his signature. Windows Mobile and Windows CE devices support signature capture started in window, which you can show over current page (scrolling is not supported in this case).

	:::ruby
	Rho::SignatureCapture.visible(visibility, params)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>visibility</code></td>
	<td>true or false.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>params</code></td>
	<td>A hash containing the parameters.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## capture

Saves signature to an image file and calls a callback. Windows Mobile and Windows CE devices support signature capture started in window, which you can show over current page (scrolling is not supported in this case).

	:::ruby
	Rho::SignatureCapture.capture(callback_url)

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>callback_url</code></td>
	<td>url to callback method called after the user enters a signature.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## clear

Clear the signature in the window. Windows Mobile and Windows CE devices support signature capture started in window, which you can show over current page (scrolling is not supported in this case).

	:::ruby
	Rho::SignatureCapture.clear()

## Hash parameters for take and visible methods

<table border="1">
<tr>
	<td><code>imageFormat</code></td>
	<td>“jpg”, “png” or “bmp” On Windows Mobile and CE devices, only bmp is supported</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>penColor</code></td>
	<td>color of pen used for drawing signature</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>penWidth</code></td>
	<td>width of pen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>bgColor</code></td>
	<td>color of background</td>
</tr>
</table>

	<td><code>left</code></td>
	<td>Sets the top left horizontal position of the rectangular capture area in pixels</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td><code>top</code></td>
	<td>Sets the top left vertical position of the rectangular capture area in pixels</td>
</tr>
<tr>
