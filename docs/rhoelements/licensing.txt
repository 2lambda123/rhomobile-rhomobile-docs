# RhoElements Licensing

The following features require Motorola RhoElements license:

* [Mobile APIs](/rhoelements/apicompatibility) indicated with <span class="label label-inverse">RHOELEMENTS</span> application type
* [Motorola WebKit](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-native#enabling-motorola-webkit)
* [Barcode extension](/rhodesapi/barcode-api)
* [NFC extension](/rhodes/device-caps#nfc)
* [Database Encryption](/rhodes/rhom#database-encryption)
* [Inline Signature Capture](/rhodes/device-caps#signature-capture)

## License for Motorola Windows Mobile and Windows CE Devices

When an application starts on a Motorola device, the License screen is displayed with the following options:

* Scan Company Name barcode, Scan License barcode.
* Enter Company name and License number manually.
* License device via Internet.

A license can also be applied by merging a .reg file into the device's registry.

Both type of Motorola RhoElements licenses can be used in this case: device (with particular device UUID) and deployment (without link to particular device UUID).

After a valid license is provided, the device become 'Licensed'. The next time the application is started, the License screen will be displayed for a short period with a 'Device is Licensed' message. If no license is provided, the License nag screen will open every so often. The application will still retain all of its functionality in an unlicensed state.

## License for Motorola Android ET1 Devices

On the ET1, a license can be applied at runtime like described above where the user can scan in the license information or enter it manual.  The exception is that the license cannot be applied via a .reg file.

## License on Non-Motorola Windows Mobile and Windows CE

Licensing will be the same as Motorola Solutions devices except that scanning will not be available. However, keying of the license and automatic assignment will still be valid input methods.

## License for Non-Motorola Android, iOS, BlackBerry

On these devices, there is no license wizard available to assist the user in licensing the framework. Instead, on a device that has not been licensed, a popup appears when the application is started warning that the framework is unlicensed.

The user must provide the Deployment License information in the application's build.yml file:

    motorola_license_company: 'Deployment License Company name'
    motorola_license: 'Deployment License Number'
 
For development purposes, this license can be an individual license. However, the compiled package will only work on the device that the license has been assigned to. This use case is most likely to only be used with "demo" licenses supplied to developers for this purpose.

For an actual release of software developed with RhoElements, the license would need to be a deployment license.  A deployment license is not restricted to a device, but will allow any device to make use of the software.Deployment licenses are restricted by name to a specific customer, and to obtain one the customer must electronically sign an online contract. 
 
## Unlicensed Devices

When a RhoElements application starts it will check to see if the devuce has been licensed. If the device has not been licensed a message will be displayed. However, the application will still be able to be executed with full functionality. 

## Common Information

Regardless of the platform, who the license is assigned to is logged to the log file at start-up. The same license will work on any OS.
