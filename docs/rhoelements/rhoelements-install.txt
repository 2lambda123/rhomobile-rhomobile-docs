# RhoMobile Suite Installation

## Windows

If you're running Windows, download the latest Motorola RhoMobile Suite for Windows and run it. This installs the [Ruby stack](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction), [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction), and [RhoElements](/rhoelements/introduction).

If you are running Windows 64-bit, you need to use 32-bit Java when you run RhoStudio. You can include the 32-bit Java in the PATH, or you can run RhoStudio with a link to 32-bit Java:

	<RhoMobile Suite Install Path>\eclipse\RhoStudio.exe -vm "<32-bit java path>\bin\javaw.exe"

Once you install Motorola RhoMobile Suite on Windows, you will see Motorola RhoMobile Suite on the Windows Start menu with the following options:

* A link to the [developer community](http://developer.motorolasolutions.com).
* A link to the [RhoMobile documentation](/home).
* A launcher for RhoStudio.
* A link to the readme file.
* A link to the RhoElements Runtime files. You use these when you create a [RhoElements hybrid application](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-webapps), or when you create a [RhoElements native application](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-native) in shared mode.
* An uninstaller for RhoMobile Suite.

## Mac OS

If you're running Mac OS, download the latest [Motorola RhoMobile Suite Installer for Macintosh](http://rhomobile.com/rhostudio-mac). This contains [Redis](http://redis.io/), [RhoConnect](/rhoconnect/introduction) and [Rhodes](/rhodes/introduction).

Although Mac OS has [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) installed, the official way to install Ruby for RhoStudio is to install [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io//) and then install Ruby version 1.9.3.

Click on the Motorola RhoMobile Suite Installer for Mac download file to open it. You will get a window similar to this:

Run "Install gems on rvm" (this requires that you have installed Ruby Version Manager). A terminal window will open; wait for the gems install process to complete.

Then drag Motorola RhoStudio to the Applications folder.

The Motorola RhoMobile Suite Installer for Macintosh also contains:

* A folder containing a RhoElements application.
* A folder containing the Rhodes system api sample application.
* A folder containing the RhoElements Runtime files. You use these when you create a [RhoElements hybrid application](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-webapps), or when you create a [RhoElements native application](/rhoelements/rhoelements2-native) in shared mode.
* A link to the Launchpad Developer Community.
* A link to the RhoMobile documentation website.

**NOTE: Installing Ruby into the System folder is not supported by RhoMobile; the official RhoMobile way to install and use Ruby on the Macintosh is with Ruby Version Manager. If you do not use Ruby Version Manager and instead install Ruby into the System folder, you will need to start and run RhoStudio from the command line using sudo.**

## Java Development Kit (JDK)

You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed for Motorola RhoMobile Suite. If you are planning to build for Android, make sure you have JDK version 1.6.0_2 or higher installed.

### Installing the Java Development Kit

The Sun JDK for Windows or Linux is available [here](http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp). For Windows, install the 32-bit version of the JDK; RhoStudio needs the 32-bit version.

For Mac OS 10.6 and earlier, the JDK is already installed. For Mac OS 10.7, Java is not automatically installed. Download the Java for Mac Installer from [Apple support](http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421) and install Java.

### Setting the JDK Path

On Windows installs for RhoMobile, go to RhoStudio Preferences (Window -> Preferences -> RhoMobile) and set the JDK path in the rhobuild.yml file. 

**NOTE: On Windows 64-bit installations, you must set this path to the 32-bit version of the JDK, such as `C:/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk<version number>/bin`.**

On Mac OS, the path to the JDK is automatically set once Java is installed.

## Setting the Location of the RhoStudio Workspace Directory

When you start RhoStudio, you can set the location of the workspace directory. The path to the workspace directory should not contain space symbols: if the path has spaces, a RhoConnect application created with RhoStudio will not work properly.
