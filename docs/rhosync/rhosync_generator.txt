RhoSync Application Generator
===

The `rhosync` utility is a command line tool for generating RhoSync applications and sources.

## Generate Application

App name is passed as a parameter.  The `rhosync` utility will generate a directory for your application with all the necessary files to get started.  We will start with running `rhosync app` to see the usage:

	:::term
	Usage: rhosync app [options] [args]

	Generates a new rhosync application.

	Required:
	  name        - application name


	Options specific for this generator:

	General options:
	    -p, --pretend                    Run, but do not make any changes.
	    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
	    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
	    -d, --delete                     Delete files that have previously been generated with this generator.
	        --no-color                   Don't colorize the output
	    -h, --help                       Show this message
	        --debug                      Do not catch errors

For example:

	:::term
	$ rhosync app storeserver
	Generating with app generator:
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/config.ru
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/settings/settings.yml
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/settings/license.key
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/application.rb
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/Rakefile
	     [ADDED]  storeserver/spec/spec_helper.rb

You will see a [sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) rackup file `config.ru` and application file `application.rb` along with several other files generated.  This will be your RhoSync sinatra application.

## Add new source

To generate a source for your RhoSync application, run the `rhosync source` command:

	:::term
	Usage: rhosync source [options] [args]

	Generates a new source adapter.

	Required:
	  name        - source name(i.e. product)


	Options specific for this generator:

	General options:
	    -p, --pretend                    Run, but do not make any changes.
	    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
	    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
	    -d, --delete                     Delete files that have previously been generated with this generator.
	        --no-color                   Don't colorize the output
	    -h, --help                       Show this message
	        --debug                      Do not catch errors
	
For example:

	:::term
	$ cd storeserver
	$ rhosync source product
	Generating with source generator:
	     [ADDED]  sources/product.rb
	     [ADDED]  spec/sources/product_spec.rb
	
This generates a source adapter file `product.rb` and corresponding [rspec](http://rspec.info/) file `product_spec.rb`.  If you choose, you can use this spec to implement the source adapter.
