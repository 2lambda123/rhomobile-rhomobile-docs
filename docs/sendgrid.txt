Sendgrid SMTP add-on
===========

[Sendgrid](http://www.sendgrid.com/) offers a modern, API driven approach to SMTP delivery. Several plans are available through the Heroku add-on, starting with their free plan offering 200 messages per day. All you need to get going with Sendgrid is to enable the add-on:

    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid
    Adding sendgrid to myapp...done.
    
This automatically creates a Sendgrid account for you, and configures ActionMailer to use it by default. See the [guide](smtp) for how to send email from Rails with ActionMailer. Remember that Sendgrid lets you specify a from-address for your emails.

NOTE: Adding this add-on requires that you have ActiveMailer in your application.  If you're using a standard Rails application, and haven't explicitly disabled ActiveMailer, there's nothing additional you need to do.  If you are using Sinatra/Merb/etc or have disabled ActionMailer, please make sure to enable/install it before installing this add-on
