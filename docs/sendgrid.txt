Sendgrid SMTP add-on
===========

[Sendgrid](http://www.sendgrid.com/) offers a modern, API driven approach to SMTP delivery. We offer two levels of Sendgrid service: the free basic service offering 200 messages per day, and the $20/month premium service that allows 30,000 emails per month.

Sendgrid Basic
--------------

To enable free Sendgrid add-on, simply run:

    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid:basic
    Adding sendgrid:basic to myapp...done.
    
This automatically creates a Sendgrid account for you, and configures ActionMailer to use it by default. See the [guide](smtp) for how to send email from Rails with ActionMailer. Remember that Sendgrid lets you specify a from-address for your emails.

Sendgrid Premium
----------------

Increasing your outgoing email capability is equally simple. To activate the premium Sendgrid add-on:

    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid:premium
    Adding sendgrid:premium to myapp...done.

NOTE: Adding this add-on requires that you have ActiveMailer in your application.  If you're using a standard Rails application, and haven't explicitly disabled ActiveMailer, there's nothing additional you need to do.  If you are using Sinatra/Merb/etc or have disabled ActionMailer, please make sure to enable/install it before installing this add-on.
