Sendgrid SMTP add-on
===========

[Sendgrid](http://www.sendgrid.com/) offers a modern, API driven approach to SMTP delivery. Several plans are available through the Heroku add-on, starting with their free plan offering 200 messages per day. All you need to get going with Sendgrid is to enable the add-on:

    $ heroku addons:add sendgrid
    Adding sendgrid to myapp...done.
    
This automatically creates a Sendgrid account for you, and configures ActionMailer to use it by default. See the guide below for [how to send email from Rails with ActionMailer](smtp). Remember that Sendgrid lets you specify a from-address for your emails.

NOTE: The Sendgrid add-on will only work for Rails apps with ActionMailer installed.
