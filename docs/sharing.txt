Sharing
=======

Inviting other developers
--------------------

Other developers can be invited to collaborate on your app, identified by email address:

    $ heroku sharing:add joe@example.com
    joe@example.com added as a full collaborator on myapp.

If the user has a Heroku account, they will be added to the collaborators list immediately.  Otherwise they will be sent an invitation email inviting them to join.  Once they join, they can access the app's code.

NOTE: There is no distinction between the original creator/owner of the app and additional collaborators.  New collaborators can run all administration functions, including renaming or destroying the app.

You can revoke a collaborator's access later:

    $ heroku sharing:remove joe@example.com
    Collaborator removed.

Use the info command to see the list of current collaborators:

    $ heroku info
    ...
    Collaborators:  adam@example.com
                    joe@example.com

Merging code changes
--------------------

Once you're collaborating with other developers, you may find that you're prevented from pushing to the repo with a message like this:

    $ git push heroku
    error: remote 'refs/heads/master' is not a strict subset of local ref 'refs/heads/master'.
    maybe you are not up-to-date and need to pull first?

This means that other developers have pushed up changes that you need to pull down and merge with your local repository.  "git pull" is the quick way to do this; see the section titled "Pulling code" for details.
