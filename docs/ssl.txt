SSL
===

SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end data encryption and
data integrity for all web requests. Apps that transmit sensitive data should
enable SSL to ensure all information is transmitted securely.

Piggyback SSL (myapp.heroku.com only)
-------------------------------------

SSL can be turned on for any `.heroku.com` domain by enabling the Piggyback SSL
add-on with the [heroku command-line tool](heroku-command):

    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku addons:add piggyback_ssl
    Adding ssl to myapp...done.

Access the app over SSL at: `https://myapp.heroku.com/`. 

NOTE: The SSL add-on can also be enabled on the web by signing into the <a
href="https://heroku.com/myapps">Heroku app admin tool</a> and customizing the
add-on section of an apps Resources page.

An app specific SSL certificate is not required for Piggyback SSL. The
`*.heroku.com` wildcard SSL certificate is used for all apps. You can view
information about this certificate by visiting <https://heroku.com/> and
clicking the lock icon <img src='/images/lock_icon.gif' height='16' width='12' alt=''>
in your browser chrome.

Custom-domain SSL (www.yourdomain.com)
--------------------------------------

Heroku offers you two choices to support running SSL on your domain, SNI and Custom SSL.  

SSL was not originally designed for a cloud environment.  An extension to SSL called [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) was introduced in 2006 to fix this problem.  SNI has full support on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Mac OS X 10.5 or later, and most linux distribution.  SNI is NOT supported on Windows XP with IE or Chrome.

For those customers who require Windows XP browser support, we offer Custom SSL.  Custom SSL works with all browsers, trading off higher cost and more complex setup and administration.

Either solution requires a SSL certificate.  For testing, you can use a [self-signed certificate](http://sial.org/howto/openssl/self-signed/).  To remove the warnings, you will need to [purchase a SSL certificate](http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ssl+certificate&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

### Custom Domain SSL with SNI 

Ensure you have the latest Heroku gem, version 1.2 or later:
 
    $ gem list heroku

    *** LOCAL GEMS ***
    heroku (1.2)

Enable SSL:

    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku addons:add sni_ssl
    Adding ssl to myapp...done.

Upload your certificate

    $ heroku ssl:add cert.pem private.key
    Added certificate to www.yourdomain.com, expiring in 2012/08/27 22:16:39 -0700

Your site will now be accessible on https://www.yourdomain.com.

### Custom Domain SSL with Custom SSL 

NOTE: Custom SSL will provide you with a new public IP address.  Due to Heroku's cloud architecture, the public IP addresses may need to be changed from time to time. When using Custom SSL, be aware that we may request that you change your settings at some point in the future. We will provide advance notice, but if you do not update your addresses, your site may stop working. 

Ensure you have the latest Heroku gem, version 1.2 or later:
 
    $ gem list heroku

    *** LOCAL GEMS ***
    heroku (1.2)

Enable SSL:

    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku addons:add custom_ssl
    Adding ssl to myapp...done.

Upload your certificate:

    $ heroku ssl:add cert.pem private.key
    Added certificate to www.yourdomain.com, expiring in 2012/08/27 22:16:39 -0700

Heroku will allocate you a public IP address and email it to you within two business days.  You will then need to configure your DNS to point to the provided IP address.
