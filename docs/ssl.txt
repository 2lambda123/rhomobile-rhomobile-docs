SSL
===

SSL is a cryptographic protocol that provides end-to-end data encryption and
data integrity for all web requests. Apps that transmit sensitive data should
enable SSL to ensure all information is transmitted securely.

Piggyback SSL (myapp.heroku.com only)
-------------------------------------

SSL can be turned on for any `.heroku.com` domain by enabling the Piggyback SSL
add-on with the [heroku command-line tool](heroku-command):

    $ cd myapp
    $ heroku addons:add piggyback_ssl
    Adding ssl to myapp...done.

Access the app over SSL at: `https://myapp.heroku.com/`. 

NOTE: The SSL add-on can also be enabled on the web by signing into the <a
href="https://heroku.com/myapps">Heroku app admin tool</a> and customizing the
add-on section of an apps Resources page.

An app specific SSL certificate is not required for Piggyback SSL. The
`*.heroku.com` wildcard SSL certificate is used for all apps. You can view
information about this certificate by visiting <https://heroku.com/> and
clicking the lock icon <img src='/images/lock_icon.gif' height='16' width='12' alt=''>
in your browser chrome.

Custom-domain SSL (www.yourdomain.com)
--------------------------------------

Custom-domain SSL support through your own certificate is not yet available. The
issue here is the SSL protocol itself, which can only present one certificate
per IP/port combination. This is fundamentally incompatible with a fully
dynamic, on-demand environment. If you've enabled Piggyback SSL, you can use SSL
on custom domains (e.g., `https://www.yourdomain.com/`) but this displays a
warning due to the domain name not matching `heroku.com`.

We recognize this as a serious platform limitation and are looking into a
variety of potential solutions to provide SSL with custom domains.
