Getting Support
===============

### The Heroku Helpdesk (support.heroku.com)

The [Heroku Helpdesk](http://support.heroku.com) is the official channel for
getting support. New requests are triaged and assigned to a Heroku engineer
immediately. If you're experiencing a problem with your app, the best way to
ensure a timely response is to [submit a ticket](http://support.heroku.com/requests/portal/new).
Using the ticket system lets you communicate directly with our support staff,
and receive email updates as soon as there's activity on your request.

NOTE: The support site includes a regularly updated
<a href="http://support.heroku.com/forums">Knowledge Base</a> with information on
the most frequently asked questions and support requests. There's a good chance
that a solution to your issue will be documented there.

When submitting support requests, please include as much information as
possible, including:

  * The app's name.
  * The exact URL where the error occured.
  * The exact error message(s).
  * Any backtraces or relevant log output.

In general, it's better to err on the side of providing too much information
rather than too little. The easier it is to reproduce the issue, the more
likely it will be diagnosed and corrected in a timely manner.

### Heroku community mailing list

The [Heroku mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/heroku/topics?gvc=2)
(heroku@googlegroups.com) is a growing user community with over a thousand
subscribers and multiple discussions every day. This is the place to talk about
general application design, Heroku related tools and technologies, or solicit
advice from peers about building apps on Heroku.

Note that the mailing list *is not an official support channel*. Many Heroku
employees participate on the mailing list but there's no guarantee that
messages sent to the list will receive a response from Heroku staff.

### IRC: #heroku

Join the `#heroku` channel on [irc.freenode.net](http://freenode.net) to chat
with other Heroku users. There's usually a few Heroku staff lurking in the
channel to answer questions as well.

Note that, like the mailing list, the `#heroku` channel *is not an official
support channel*. [Open a ticket](http://support.heroku.com/requests/portal/new)
with support if you have a pressing issue or question that requires immediate
attention.
