# Verification & Billing

Basic usage of Heroku is free. However, to access certain add-on features we ask that you verify your account with us by providing your contact and credit card information.

The reason we ask for this info is mainly for abuse prevention reasons. As a business we need to be able contact our users reliably in the event of a problem. 

You can rest assured that Heroku will never charge you unless you've ordered paid services and explicitly confirmed your agreement to be billed on a monthly basis.

## Verification

Account verification let's you use any of our free add-ons, and gives you access to turn on paid services any time with a few easy clicks. You only need to verify once per account. There are two places in which you'll be prompted to complete verification:

### 1. From The Heroku Client

If you try to add an add-on, such as Custom Domains, to your app from an unverified account, you'll see a message directing you to the verification URL:

	$ heroku addons:add custom_domains
	Adding custom_domains to quiet-mist-49...FAILED
	!    Before activating this add-on you must verify your account:
	!    Please visit http://heroku.com/verify to set up your account.
	
Open the URL in your browser of choice, and you'll see the verification form. Fill it out, and you'll be ready use add-ons and order more dyno and databases resources when you need them.

### 2. The App Resources Page

For each app listed on the [MyApps page](http://heroku.com/myapps), there's a "Resources" page that will let you select add-ons, increase your dynos and change your database size. The first time you to the Resources page for one of your apps, the header will look like this - indicating no changes have been made:

NOTE: If you select a paid resource or add-on, you'll skip verification and go straight to confirming your billing information.
