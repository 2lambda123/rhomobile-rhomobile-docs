Verification & Billing
=======

Basic usage of Heroku is free. However, to access certain add-on features we ask that you verify your account with us by providing your contact and credit card information.

The reason we ask for this info is mainly for abuse prevention reasons. As a business we need to be able contact our users reliably in the event of a problem. 

You can rest assured that Heroku will never charge you unless you've ordered paid services and explicitly confirmed your agreement to be billed on a monthly basis.

Verification
---------------

Account verification let's you use any of our free add-ons, and gives you access to turn on paid services any time with a few easy clicks.
