<div class='tableofcontents'> </div><h1>PowerOn</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The PowerOn API is used to register to receive an event when the device is resumed from suspend mode.</p>

<h2>Enabling the API</h2>

<p>In order to use this API you must include reference to the following JavaScript file that is included with the Enterprise Browser installation:</p>

<ul>
<li>elements.js</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Note &ndash; this file either needs to be on the device in a relative folder from where your HTML page is, or it must be copied to your web server appropriately.</p></blockquote>

<pre name="code" class="html">&lt;script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="elements.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;;
</pre>

<h3>API Usage</h3>

<p>This API does not use the <code>EB</code> namespace. It is simply referenced using the API name:</p>

<pre name="code" class="javascript">powerOn.powerOnEvent = "url('JavaScript:powerOnCallback(%json)';)";
</pre>

<h2>Events</h2>

<p>To handle events, you assign a string value to the event name that represents a function name or JavaScript statement to execute.</p>

<h3>powerOnEvent</h3>

<p>The PowerOnEvent is sent whenever the device is resumed from suspend mode. There is no data associated with this event.</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<h3>Example usage</h3>

<p>This feature is very useful for security. Navigating to an offline page (file:// protocol) when the device is powered on can be used to request a pin number from the user.</p>

<h3>Use when cradled</h3>

<p>Windows Power events will not always be generated when the device is connected to power and instructed to stand by / wake up, though this is dependent on the Operating System in use.</p>
