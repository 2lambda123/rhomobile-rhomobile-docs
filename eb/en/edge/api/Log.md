#Log


## Overview
<p> Use this API to control the behavior of the RhoMobile Log API as well as access it.</p>
<p>This API gives access to Rhodes Logging functionality. There are five functions to add messages to the log with different severity (from lowest to highest) : trace, info, warning, error and fatal. Each of those functions gets two parameters: message and category. Category is an user defined group that helps with used  searching and filtering.</p>

<p>Accessing Log File:
sendLogFile: will sent all the log to server
showLog: brings up popup with log,
readLogFile: returns the full log file,
cleanLogFile: removes all logged messages</p>

<p>Filtering:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Using level property: It limits minimal severity of messages that will be added to log. For example: setting log level to 2 (warning) will filter out messages generated by trace and info.</p></li>
<li><p>Categories: user defined groups that are used to select messages from different modules for ease of use. There are two main filters: includeCategories and excludeCategories. They are both active at the same time. includeCategories allows to select groups/categories that should be in the log (setting this property to empty will turn disable logging). excludeCategories is used for filtering out some of categories.</p></li>
<li><p>excludeFilter, this filter is used to remove all sensitive information like passwords, security tokens from log.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Log destinations (any combinations of them):</p>

<ul>
<li>debug console (stdio),</li>
<li>device filesystem (file)</li>
<li>remote sever (url)</li>
</ul>
