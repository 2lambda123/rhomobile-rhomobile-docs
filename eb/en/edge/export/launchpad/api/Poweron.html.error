It is simply referenced using the API name:</p>\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">powerOn.powerOnEvent = \"url('JavaScript:powerOnCallback(%json)';)\";\n</pre>\n\n<h2>Events</h2>\n\n<p>To handle events, you assign a string value to the event name that represents a function name or JavaScript statement to execute.</p>\n\n<h3>powerOnEvent</h3>\n\n<p>The PowerOnEvent is sent whenever the device is resumed from suspend mode. There is no data associated with this event.</p>\n\n<h2>Remarks</h2>\n\n<h3>Example usage</h3>\n\n<p>This feature is very useful for security. Navigating to an offline page (file:// protocol) when the device is powered on can be used to request a pin number from the user.</p>\n\n<h3>Use when cradled</h3>\n\n<p>Windows Power events will not always be generated when the device is connected to power and instructed to stand by / wake up, though this is dependent on the Operating System in use.</p>\n"},"type":"document","minor":true,"parent":"https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/api/core/v3/places/38912"}
