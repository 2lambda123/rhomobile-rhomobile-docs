<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In order to get Barcode data in your application, you must create a profile with two profile features selected:</p>

<ul>
<li>Barcode</li>
<li>Intent or Keystroke</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>Barcode</code> feature in the Profile Manager is responsible for reading data from the device&rsquo;s integrated bar code scanner and supports different types of bar code readers including laser, imager and internal camera. It also contains detailed settings for scanner behavior as well as individual barcode symbology settings.</p>

<p>The <code>Intent</code> or <code>Keystroke</code> feature in the Profile Manager is used to define how the output from the Barcode scanner should be handled.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Intent &ndash; The Intent feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application using the Android Intent mechanism. To use this, you should be familiar with how to register to receive intents in your application as well as handling the data that is passed in. You will have the ability to configure how the intent is sent to your application in the profile itself.</p></li>
<li><p>Keystroke &ndash; The Keystroke feature, in the Profile Manager, collects and sends data received from the Barcode scanner to your application by emulating keystrokes. You will have the option to control how the data is sent as well as if it should have any prefix or suffix automatically added using basic data formatting.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Security Level &ndash; The scanner offers four levels of decode security for UPC/EAN bar codes. Select higher security levels for lower quality bar codes. There is an inverse relationship between security and decode speed, so be sure to choose only that level of security necessary for the application.

<ul>
<li>Level 0 &ndash; This default setting allows the scanner to operate fastest, while providing sufficient security in decoding “in-spec” UPC/EAN bar codes.</li>
<li>Level 1 &ndash; As bar code quality levels diminish, certain characters become prone to misdecodes before others (i.e., 1, 2, 7, 8). If the scanner is misdecoding poorly printed bar codes, and the misdecodes are limited to these characters, select this security level.</li>

<li>Level 3 &ndash; If the scanner is still misdecoding, select this security level. Be advised, selecting this option is an extreme measure against misdecoding severely out of spec bar codes. Selecting this level of security can significantly impair the decoding ability of the scanner. If this level of security is necessary, try to improve the quality of the bar codes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Supplemental2 &ndash; Enables or disables this option.</li>
<li>Supplemental5 &ndash; Enables or disables this option.</li>
<li>Supplemental Mode

<ul>
<li>No Supplementals &ndash; the scanner is presented with a UPC/EAN plus supplemental symbol, the
scanner decodes UPC/EAN and ignores the supplemental characters.</li>
<li>Supplemental Always &ndash; the scanner only decodes UPC/EAN symbols with supplemental characters, and ignores symbols without supplementals.</li>
<li>Supplements Auto &ndash; the scanner decodes UPC/EAN symbols with supplemental characters immediately. If the symbol does not have a supplemental, the scanner must decode the bar code the number of times set via UPC/EAN Supplemental Redundancy before transmitting its data to confirm that there is no supplemental.</li>
<li>Supplemental Smart &ndash; Enables smart supplementals. In this mode the decoder returns the decoded value of the main block right away if it does not belong to one of the following supplemental types: 378, 379, 977, 978, 979, 414, 419, 434 or 439. If the bar code starts with one of the prefixes it searches the image more aggressively for a supplemental. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.</li>
<li>Supplemental 378-379 &ndash; Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 378 or 379. Disables reading of supplementals for any other UPC/EAN bar code not starting with 378 or 379. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.</li>
<li>Supplemental 978-979 &ndash; Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 978 or 979. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN bar code not starting with 978 or 979. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main barcode is returned.</li>
<li>Supplemental 414-419-434-439 &ndash; Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 414, 419, 434 or 439. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN bar code not starting with 414, 419, 434 or 439. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.</li>
<li>Supplemental 977 &ndash; Enables (auto-discriminate) supplemental for UPC/EAN codes starting with 977. Disables reading of supplementals for another UPC/EAN barcode not starting with 977. Tries to scan the supplemental if it is present. If the supplemental scanning failed, then the main bar code is returned.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Retry Count &ndash; Retry count for auto-discriminating for supplementals. Possible values are 2 to 20 inclusive. Note that this flag is only considered if Supplemental Mode &ndash; UPC EAN is set to one of the following values: Supplementals Auto, Supplementals Smart, Supplementals 378-379, Supplementals 978-979, Supplementals 977 or Supplementals 414-419-434-439 (2 to 20).</li>
<li>Bookland &ndash; Enable or disable this option.</li>
<li>Coupon &ndash; Enables Coupon code decoding. Note that in order to successfully decode Coupon codes, all
of the correct decoders must be enabled.</li>
<li>Convert DataBar To UPC EAN &ndash; If this is set it converts DataBar bar codes to UPC/EAN format. For this setting to work UPC/EAN symbologies must be enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p>Allows the configuration of parameters specific to the selected bar code reader.</p>

<ul>
<li>Beam Timer &ndash; Sets the maximum amount of time that the reader remains on (0 &ndash; 60,000 ms in increments of 100 ms). A value of 0 sets the reader to stay on indefinitely.</li>
<li>Linear Security Level &ndash; Sets the number of times a bar code is read to confirm an accurate decode.

<ul>
<li>Security Redundancy and Length &ndash; Two times read redundancy based on redundancy flags and
code length.</li>
<li>Security Short or Codabar &ndash; Two times read redundancy if short bar code or Codabar.</li>
<li>Security All Twice &ndash; Two times read redundancy for all bar codes.</li>
<li>Security Long and Short &ndash; Two times read redundancy for long bar codes, three times for short bar codes.</li>
<li>Security All Thrice &ndash; Three times read redundancy for all bar codes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Picklist &ndash; Allows the imager to decode only the bar code that is directly under the cross-hair/reticle (+) part of the pattern. This feature is useful in applications where multiple bar codes may appear in the field of view during a decode session and only one of them is targeted for decode.

<ul>
<li>Disable – Disables Picklist mode. Any bar code within the field of view can be decoded.</li>
<li>Centered &ndash; Enables the Picklist mode so that only the bar code in the center of the image is decoded. This is most useful when used in conjunction with the static and dynamic reticle viewfinder modes. Note: This mode is only valid for decoder modules that supports a viewfinder. If one tries to set this for a unsupported decoder then the device would issue an error. (Camera scanner only).</li>
<li>Reticle &ndash; Enables the Picklist mode so that only the bar code that is directly under the cross-hair (reticle) is decoded. This is useful when used in conjunction with the static and dynamic reticle viewfinder modes. (Scan Module Only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>LCD Mode &ndash; Enables or disables LCD mode. LCD mode enhances the ability of the imager to read bar codes from LCD displays such as cellphones (Scan Module Only).</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable &ndash; Disables the LCD mode.</li>
<li>Enable &ndash; Enables LCD mode.</li>
</ul>


<p>  NOTE When using the LCD mode, a degradation in performance may be observed and the aiming crosshair may blink until the bar code is decoded.</p></li>
<li><p>Inverse 1D Mode &ndash; This parameter allows the user to select decoding on inverse 1D bar codes.</p>

<ul>
<li>Disable &ndash; Disables decoding of inverse 1D bar codes.</li>
<li>Enable &ndash; Enables decoding of only inverse 1D bar codes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Viewfinder Enabled &ndash; Enables only the viewfinder.</li>
<li>Static Reticle &ndash; Enables the viewfinder and a red reticle in the center of the screen which helps selecting the bar code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Scan Params</h3>

<p>Allows the configuration of Code Id and decode feedback options.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Code ID Type &ndash; A Code ID character identifies the code type of a scanned bar code. This is useful when the reader is decoding more than one code type. Select a code ID character to insert between the prefix and the decoded symbol.</p>

<ul>
<li>Code ID Type None &ndash; No prefix (default).</li>
<li>Code ID Type Aim &ndash; A standards based three character prefix.</li>
<li>Code ID Type Symbol &ndash; A Symbol defined single character prefix.</li>
</ul>
