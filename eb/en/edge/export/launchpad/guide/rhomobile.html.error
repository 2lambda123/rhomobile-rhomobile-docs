It does not support any Ruby API&rsquo;s or usage from RhoMobile applications.</p>\n\n<h2>JavaScript Usage</h2>\n\n<p>In RhoElements 4.x, access to the features were made available through JavaScript objects under the <code>Rho.</code> namespace:</p>\n\n<pre name=\"code\" class=\"javascript\">// Scan with default options\nRho.Barcode.take({}, scan_received);\n</pre>\n\n<p>To use the <code>Rho.</code> namespace, you must replace the <code>rhoapi-modules.js</code> file that came with RhoMobile Suite 4.x with the file <code>rhoapi-modules.js</code> that came with Enterprise Browser found in the Enterprise Browser installation folder</p>\n\n<!-- > TBD Insert Screen Shot    -->\n\n\n<h2>Intents Android Limitation</h2>\n\n<p>On Android Broadcast Intents are set up at build time. To listen to broadcasts from other applications, an entry must be included in the Manifest file for the application to receive them. Since Enterprise Browser is a fixed APK, Broadcast listening will not be possible.</p>\n"},"type":"document","minor":true,"parent":"https://developer.motorolasolutions.com/api/core/v3/places/38904"}
