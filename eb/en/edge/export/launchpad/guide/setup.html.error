To remove it, you will need to manually remove the folder and copy files that are found in the non-volatile area of memory.\n\n### Android\nUse Android Settings applet to remove the Enterprise Browser from the device.-->\n\n\n\n\n<!-- To install the drivers for that device. Usually this is done by simply plugging the device into the machine. Most of the time, the device driver will install automatically and you'll be good to go. If not, you'll need to download the drivers for that device. To get the drivers for your device, you'll need to find the device page on [motorolasolutions.com](http://www.motorolasolutions.com/). The best way to do this is enter your device's model number into the search bar at the top of the landing page. Once you have found your device, you should see a tab to download software. For instance, the drivers for the TC55 are [here](http://goo.gl/mjrqMM).\n\nThe page you want should look something like this:\n\n![img](http://ebzebra.github.io/docs/1.3/images/getting-started/setup/setup-device-drivers-download.png) \n\n1. The ActiveSync installer will deploy the selected Enterprise Browser runtime files to the device. \n2.
