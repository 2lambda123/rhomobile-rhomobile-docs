<div class='tableofcontents'> </div><h1>Enterprise Browser MD Template</h1>

<p>All documents must start with a H1. This will be used as the title in Launchpad and Also in the Offline version for searching. The title must be unique across the set of documents (Launchpad restriction)</p>

<h2>Usage Notes</h2>

<h3>Use of Markdown</h3>

<p>The H2 and H3 will be used to generate a &lsquo;In This Document&rsquo; sidebar on the right. It uses Tocify.js to autogenerate</p>

<h3>Links to Content</h3>

<p>Links can use standard MD format for links using Parenthesis and Brackets (not numbered notation) BUT the link must always be starting with &lsquo;../folder/filename&rsquo; (even if it is in the same folder as the current document). The parent folder/filename is used as a &lsquo;key&rsquo; for the document in the offline version search and is used for rewriting URLs for Launchpad</p>

<p>Ex:
<a href="../api/Adapter">Adapter Link</a></p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<p>Need to put instructions for images here</p>

<h3>Code snippets</h3>

<p>We will be using Syntaxhighlighter.js for code highlight in both Launchpad (uses version 1.5) and offline. use Standard tabbing and the first line should be the language indicator</p>

<pre name="code" class="javascript">//Here is some sample JS that should be JS highlighted
var foo = 5;
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Use Url encoding for special characters in code block especially less than &lt;, greater then &gt; and amperstand &amp;</li>
</ul>
