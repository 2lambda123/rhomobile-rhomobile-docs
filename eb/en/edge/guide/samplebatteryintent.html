<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>On Motorola Solutions Android devices like the MC40, extra battery information can be retrieved using the standard <a href="http://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/battery-monitoring.html">Android Battery Intent</a>. Setting up to receive this information is the same as with consumer Android devices. However, the data that is returned to your application includes some extra information like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Backup Battery Voltage</li>
<li>Battery Manufacture Date</li>
<li>Battery Serial Number</li>
<li>Part Number for Battery</li>
<li>Unique ID for Battery</li>
<li>Rated Capacity of the Battery</li>
<li>Charge Cycle count of the Battery</li>
</ul>
