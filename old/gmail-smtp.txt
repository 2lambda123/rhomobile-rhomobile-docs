GMail SMTP add-on
=================

Google offers free outbound SMTP services as part of Gmail, up to 500 emails
per day.  Heroku provides an add-on that enables you to send email without additional configuration.

NOTE: This add-on is a convienience wrapper around the TLS libraries & configuring your username and password.  If you would prefer not to use this add-on, or need to move off Heroku at any time, you can use standard Rails mail configuration as outlined in our outbound email doc.

Enable it as follows:

    :::term
    $ heroku addons:add gmail_smtp user=you@gmail.com password=yourpass
    Adding gmail_smtp to myapp...done.

Use your existing GMail account or create a new one just for your app.  You can
also use a Google Apps hosted domain, just substitute you@yourdomain.com for
you@gmail.com.

Once activated, ActionMailer will be automatically configured to send through
your GMail account.  See the [outbound email doc](smtp#sending-email-from-rails) if you're not
already using ActionMailer.

NOTE: Adding this add-on requires that you have ActiveMailer in your application.  If you're using a standard Rails application, and haven't explicitly disabled ActiveMailer, there's nothing additional you need to do.  If you are using Sinatra/Merb/etc or have disabled ActionMailer, please make sure to enable/install it before installing this add-on

NOTE: The From header on the email will always be the GMail email address, so
use account with the email you want people to see and potentially reply to.

You don't need to install any additional plugins or gems in your app to use
this add-on; a plugin is installed at deploy time as part of the slug compile
process.  You also don't need to configure ActionMailer in your code.  You
should therefore delete the smtp_tls plugin, any ActionMailer initializer, or
any other support libraries that you have have formerly installed in your app
to enable sending mail through GMail or other external SMTP provider.

NOTE: The GMAIL_SMTP_USER and GMAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD config vars are stored based
on the values specified by user= and password= during the addon install.  You
can view and update these values using heroku config, heroku config:add, etc
commands as you would any other config vars.
