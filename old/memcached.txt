Memcached
=========

Memcached is a key technology in scaling any web app beyond a certain size.  Used in combination with the Varnish HTTP cache, you can build extremely high-traffic sites, even with a relatively slow interpreted language like Ruby.

Heroku apps that have the "memcached" addon installed have access to a
[memcached cluster](http://heroku.com/how/architecture#memory-cache):

    heroku addons:add memcached

You can use this in several ways: caching page or page fragments from Rails,
caching ActiveRecord models to reduce load on the database, or to cache any
arbitrary data from any kind of Rack app.

Basic Configuration
-------------------

The memcached server list and namespace are provided to all dyno, rake, and
worker process via environment variables. `MEMCACHE_SERVERS` is a comma
separated list of `IP:PORT` host entries; `MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE` is the
system assigned namespace for your app.

For Rails apps, we recommend creating a `config/initializers/memcached.rb`
file with the contents:

    if ENV['MEMCACHE_SERVERS']
      require 'memcache'
      servers = ENV['MEMCACHE_SERVERS'].split(',')
      namespace = ENV['MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE']
      CACHE = MemCache.new(servers, :namespace => namespace)
    end

**IMPORTANT:** You must use the `MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE` provided when connecting
to the memcached cluster. Failure to do so will result in undefined
behavior.

The `CACHE` constant can now be used anywhere in the application to access
the memcached cluser:

    >>> CACHE.set("hello:world:1234", "Hello World!")
    >>> CACHE.get("hello:world:1234")
    "Hello World"

See also: [memcache-client API doc](http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/memcache-client/).

The rest of this document describes configuring specific caching frameworks
for common scenarios but assumes the `CACHE` constant is established as
described above.

Rails page caching
------------------

The highest-performance technique for caching an entire public page is using a Cache-control header, as described in the section on [HTTP caching](/http-caching).  This will cause the page to be served from Varnish and never even hit your dyno, and should be used wherever possible.

If your page is private, then cache headers won't work, since you need to validate each user by cookie.  In this case, Rails' built-in page and fragment caching is a good in-betweeen solution (not as fast as HTTP page caching, but still much faster than rerendering on every pageview).

To configure ActionController to use Memcache as your cache store, add this
to your `config/environments/production.rb`:

    if ENV['MEMCACHE_SERVERS']
      memcache_config = ENV['MEMCACHE_SERVERS'].split(',')
      memcache_config << {:namespace => ENV['MEMCACHE_NAMESPACE']}
      config.cache_store = :mem_cache_store, memcache_config
    end

When should you use page caching (caches_action in the controller) vs. fragment caching (cache blocks inside the Erb template)?

If your site is private, but a particular page looks the same for all users who login, then use caches_action.  For example, the dashboard of an internal admin site might have a controller like this:

    class AdminController < ApplicationController
      before_filter :authenticate_user
      caches_action :index

This would cause the authenticate_user to be executed for each pageview, but the complete contents of the page are cached and no rendering need be done after the first pass.

If you have parts of your page that are customized to each user (such as a header showing the username), but other parts which are the same for everyone, place your cacheable HTML into a cache do .. end block.  For example:

    <h1>Hello, <%= user %></h1>

    <% cache do %>
      Most popular posts this week:
      <%= render :partial => 'top_posts' %>
    <% end %>

ActiveRecord model caching
--------------------------

If you feel that you need to rerender the entire page on each pageview, but your model data is often the same, you can reduce the load on your database by caching the models.  One way to do this from Rails is the cached_model plugin.

Install the gem in your app.  You can use Rails gem dependencies and vendor
the gem, or add it to your <a href="/gems">gems manifest</a>.

To use, inherit your model from `CachedModel` instead of
`ActiveRecord::Base`:

    require 'cached_model'
    class Post < CachedModel

Local dev setup
---------------

For local work, you can simulate Memcached with an in-memory hash.  (This works fine, since you only run one script/server process.)  Add this to your config/environment/development.rb:

    CACHE = {}

Alternately, you might wish to run the `memcached` daemon locally.  This is a little more setup, but has the benefit of being identical to production, and should be used if you use features such as incr/decr.

Install memcached on OS X with:

    :::term
    $ sudo port install memcached

Or on Ubuntu with:

    :::term
    $ sudo apt-get install memcached

Install the client gem:

    :::term
    $ sudo gem install memcache-client

Start the daemon with very verbose logging enabled:

    :::term
    $ memcached -vv
    slab class   1: chunk size     88 perslab 11915
    slab class   2: chunk size    112 perslab  9362
    slab class   3: chunk size    144 perslab  7281

Now pass a `MEMCACHE_SERVERS` environment variable to all commands:

    :::term
    $ MEMCACHE_SERVERS=localhost:11211 script/console
    Loading development environment (Rails 2.3.2)
    >> CACHE['foo'] = 'baz'
    => "baz"

Switch back to the memcached terminal and you'll see the logging for your
set operation:

    <18 set foo 0 0 7
    >18 STORED
